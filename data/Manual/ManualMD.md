**1 Introduction**

**1.1 Medium speed propulsion engine programme**

```
MAN 32/40 IMO Tier III, Project Guide – Marine, EN 11 (451)
```

### 1.2 Engine description MAN 32/40 IMO Tier III

```
General
```
```
The “Work Horse” MAN 32/40 is in service 24 hours a day. With a power
output range of 3,000 to 9,000 kW, it is ideal for small and medium sized
applications. The interacting of all important parts results to low wear rates
and long maintenance intervals.
```
```
Marine main engines
```
```
Engine output is limited to 100 % of rated output for engines driving a pro-
peller. Engine output is limited to 110 % of rated output for engines driving a
alternator. Overload above 100 % permitted only briefly to prevent a fre-
quency drop during sudden load application.
```
```
Fuels for operation with SCR catalyst
```
```
The SCR components were special designed for operation with heavy fuel oil
(HFO) in accordance with specification DIN ISO 8217 up to sulphur content
of max. 3.5 % and optimised for our engine portfolio.
```
```
Fuels
```
```
The MAN 32/40 engine can be operated on heavy fuel oil with a viscosity up
to 700 mm^2 /s (cSt) at 50 °C. It is designed for fuel up to levels of quality
RMK700 according ISO8217 or RK700 according CIMAC 2003.
```
```
Stepped piston
```
```
Forged dimensionally stable steel crown (with shaker cooling) made from
high grade materials and skirt in spheroidal graphite cast iron (skirt also avail-
able in steel upon request). The stepped piston and the fire ring together pre-
vent “bore polishing” of the cylinder liner, thereby reducing operating costs
by keeping lubricating oil consumption consistently low. Chromium ceramic
coating of the first piston ring with wear resistant ceramic particles in the ring
surface results in minimal wear and tear, ensuring extremely long periods
between maintenance.
```
```
MAN Diesel & Turbo turbocharging system
```
```
Industry leading designed constant pressure turbocharging system using
state-of-the-art MAN Diesel & Turbo turbochargers with long bearing over-
haul intervals. High efficiency at full and part loads results in substantial air
surplus and complete combustion without residues and with low thermal
stresses on the combustion chamber components.
```
```
Cylinder head
```
```
The cylinder head has optimised combustion chamber geometry for
improved injection spray atomisation. This ensures balanced air-fuel mixture,
reducing combustion residue, soot formation and improving fuel economy.

```

```
Valves
```
```
Exhaust valves are designed with armoured, water cooled seats that keep
valve temperatures down. Propellers on the exhaust valve shaft provide rota-
tion by exhaust gas, resulting in the cleaning effect of the valve seat area dur-
ing valve closing.
```
```
Service friendly design
```
```
Hydraulic tooling for tightening and loosening cylinder head nuts; clamps
with quick release fasteners and/or clamp and plug connectors; generously
sized access covers.
```
```
Cylinder liner
```
```
The precision machined cylinder liner and separate cooling water collar rest
on top of the engine frame and is there isolated from any external deforma-
tion, ensuring optimum piston performance and long service life.
```
```
SCR technology
```
```
MAN Diesel & Turbo decided to develop it's own SCR technology to be able
to optimise the emissions technology and the engine performance in addition
with the MAN Diesel & Turbo own SCR control programme to the utmost
customer benefit.
Common SCR systems require constantly high exhaust gas temperatures.
The MAN Diesel & Turbo SCR system however is an integrated system
(engine + SCR) that is automatically adjusting the exhaust gas temperature in
an optimal way to ensure ideal operation of both engine and SCR. For exam-
ple, the engine is operating at optimum condition, however the system is
registering an increasing backpressure over the SCR reactor. To resolve this,
the regeneration feature of the integrated SCR system is activated and the
wastegate engaged to increase exhaust gas temperature. After a short time,
the SCR system is regenerated and the engine can continue operation in the
design point area. Thus the SCR assures ideal engine operation by regener-
ating the SCR system whenever necessary to achieve minimum fuel oil con-
sumption. Nevertheless, the SCR system complies with the IMO Tier III regu-
lations on NOX emissions at any time.
```
```
Electronics – SaCoSone
```
```
The MAN 32/40 IMO Tier III is equipped with the latest generation of proven
MAN Diesel & Turbo engine management systems. SaCoSone combines all
functions of modern engine management into one complete system. Thor-
oughly integrated with the engine, it forms one unit with the drive assembly.
SaCoSone offers:
▪ Integrated self-diagnosis functions
▪ Maximum reliability and availability
▪ Simple use and diagnosis
▪ Quick exchange of modules (plug in)
▪ Trouble-free and time-saving commissioning
▪ CCM plus OMD
```

**1 Introduction**

**1.2 Engine description MAN 32/40 IMO Tier III**

```
MAN 32/40 IMO Tier III, Project Guide – Marine, EN 13 (451)
```

```
As a standard for all our 4-stroke medium speed engines manufactured
in Augsburg, these engines will be equipped with a Crankcase Monitor-
ing System (CCM = Splash oil & Main bearing temperature) plus OMD
(Oil mist detection). OMD and CCM are integral part of the MAN Diesel &
Turbo ́s safety philosophy and the combination of both will increase the
possibility to early detect a possible engine failure and prevent subse-
quent component damage.
```
```
Device for variable injection timing (VIT)
```
```
The VIT is designed to influence injection timing and thus ignition pressure
and combustion temperature. That enables engine operation in different load
ranges well balanced between low NOx emissions and low fuel consumption.
```
```
New piston for increased compression ratio
```
```
The use of a new piston provides a higher compression ratio and gives a
faster reduction in temperature after the ignition of the fuel, thus reducing
NOx formation. The increase in compression ratio also compensates the
reduction in firing temperature due to retarded injection and hence the asso-
ciated increase in SFOC.
```
```
Committed to the future
```
```
Technologies which promise compliance with the IMO Tier III emission limits
valid from 2016 combined with further optimised fuel consumption and new
levels of power and flexibility are already under development at MAN Diesel &
Turbo. With this level of commitment MAN Diesel & Turbo customers can
plan with confidence.
```
```
Optional feature – Sealed Plunger Injection Pumps (SP Injection Pumps)
```
```
The MAN 32/40 is equipped with standard injection pumps.
As option the MAN 32/40 conventional injection system may be equipped
with Sealed Plunger Injection Pumps. SP Injection Pumps have been
designed for an operation with all specified fuel.
Benefit:
+ The fuel and the lube oil within the injection pumps are completely separa-
ted and cannot get in contact with each other, so that the leakage fuel of the
SP Injection Pumps can be completely reused again.
+ For the same reason, there is no need for sealing oil anymore in the case of
continuous MGO-operation.
```
```
Core technologies in-house
```
```
As well as its expertise in engine design, development and manufacture,
MAN Diesel & Turbo is also a leader in the engineering and manufacturing of
the key technologies which determine the economic and ecological perform-
ance of a diesel engine and constitute the best offer for our customers:
▪ High efficiency turbochargers
▪ Advanced electronic fuel injection equipment
▪ Electronic hardware and software for engine control, monitoring and
1 Introduction diagnosis

```
```
Destination/suitability of the engine
```
```
Note:
Regardless of their technical capabilities, engines of our design and the
respective vessels in which they are installed must at all times be operated in
line with the legal requirements, as applicable, including such requirements
that may apply in the respective geographical areas in which such engines
are actually being operated.
```
```
Operation of the engine outside the specified operated range, not in line with
the media specifications or under specific emergency situations (e.g. sup-
pressed load reduction or engine stop by active "Override", triggered fire-
fighting system, crash of the vessel, fire or water ingress inside engine room)
is declared as not intended use of the engine (for details see engine specific
operating manuals). If an operation of the engine occurs outside of the scope
of supply of the intended use a thorough check of the engine and its compo-
nents needs to be performed by supervision of the MAN Diesel & Turbo serv-
ice department. These events, the checks and measures need to be docu-
mented.
```
```
Electric and electronic components attached to the engine –
Required engine room temperature
```
```
In general our engine components meet the high requirements of the Marine
Classification Societies. The electronic components are suitable for proper
operation within an air temperature range from 0 °C to 55 °C. The electrical
equipment is designed for operation at least up to 45 °C.
Relevant design criteria for the engine room air temperature:
Minimum air temperature in the area of the engine and its components
≥ 5 °C.
Maximum air temperature in the area of the engine and its components
≤ 45 °C.
Note:
2 Engine and operation Condensation of the air at engine components must be prevented.

22 (451) MAN 32/40 IMO Tier III, Project Guide – Marine, EN


```
Note:
It can be assumed that the air temperature in the area of the engine and
attached components will be 5 – 10 K above the ambient air temperature
outside the engine room. If the temperature range is not observed, this can
affect or reduce the lifetime of electrical/electronic components at the engine
or the functional capability of engine components. Air temperatures at the
engine > 55 °C are not permissible.
```
### 2.2 Certification IMO Tier III

```
The engine's certification for compliance with NOx limits according to NOx
technical code will be done according scheme B, meaning engine and SCR
will be handled as separate parts. Certification has to be in line with IMO
Resolution MEPC 198(62), adopted 15 July 2011.
Emission level engine: IMO Tier II
Emission level engine + SCR catalyst: IMO Tier III
```
```
Certification of engine
```
```

MEPC 198(62) for a scaled, standardised SCR reactor and SCR compo-
nents based on product features and following scaled parameters:
▪ Exhaust gas mass flow
▪ Exhaust gas composition (NOx, O 2 , CO 2 , H 2 O, SO 2 )
▪ Exhaust gas temperature
▪ Catalyst modules (AV, SV or LV value)
▪ Reducing agent
▪ Desired NOx conversion rate
The On-board Confirmation Test required for a scheme B certification will be
done for the parent engine plus SCR system for a group according to IMO
resolution MEPC 198(62).
```
### 2.3 SCR – Special notes

### 2.3.1 Principle of SCR technology

```
The selective catalytic reduction SCR uses ammonia (NH 3 ) to convert nitro-
gen oxides in the exhaust gas to harmless nitrogen and water within a cata-
lyst. However, ammonia is a hazardous substance which has to be handled
carefully to avoid any dangers for crews, passengers and the environment.
Therefore urea as a possible ammonia source is used. Urea is harmless and,

**2 Engine and operation**

**2.3 SCR – Special notes**

```
MAN 32/40 IMO Tier III, Project Guide – Marine, EN 23 (451)
```

```
solved in water, it is easy to transport and to handle. Today, aqueous urea
solutions of 32.5 % or 40 % are the choice for SCR operation in mobile
applications on land and at sea.
Using urea, the reaction within the exhaust gas pipe and the catalyst consists
of two steps. In the beginning, the urea decomposes in the hot exhaust gas
to ammonia and carbon dioxide using the available water in the injected solu-
tion and the heat of the exhaust gas:
(NH 2 ) 2 CO + H 2 O -> 2NH 3 + CO 2 [1]
The literal NOx-reduction takes place supported by the catalyst, where
ammonia reduces nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and water.
4NO + 4NH 3 + O 2 -> 4N 2 + 6H 2 O [2]
```
### 2.3.2 System overview

```
The MAN Diesel & Turbo SCR system is available in different sizes to cover
the whole medium speed engine portfolio. The SCR system consists of the
reactor, the mixing unit, the urea supply system, the pump module, the dos-
ing unit, the control unit and the soot-blowing system.
After initial start-up of the engine, the SCR system operates continuously in
automatic mode. The amount of urea injection into the SCR system depends
on the operating conditions of the engine. Since the control unit of the SCR
system is connected to the engine control system all engine related informa-
tions are continuously and currently available. This is one of the important
benefits of the MAN Diesel & Turbo SCR system.
The urea is sprayed into the mixing unit which is part of the exhaust gas
duct. Entering the reactor the reducing agent starts to react with NOx coming
from the combustion. The amount of reducing agent is controlled by the dos-
ing unit, which is supported by a pump connected to an urea tank. It further-
more regulates the compressed air flow for the injector.
Each reactor is equipped with a soot blowing system to prevent blocking of
the SCR catalyst by ashes and soot.
```

### 2.3.4 Operation

```
Standard operation
Common SCR systems provided by third parties require constantly high
exhaust gas temperatures. The MAN Diesel & Turbo SCR system on the
other hand is an integrated engine + SCR system that allows operation on
lower exhaust gas temperature levels.
The MAN Diesel & Turbo SCR system automatically adjusts the engine
exhaust gas temperature to ensure both optimum engine and SCR opera-
tion. For a maximum on safety the surveillance mode is always activated.
Enhanced operation
The MAN Diesel & Turbo SCR system assures ideal engine operation, regen-
erating the SCR system whenever necessary to account for a minimum fuel
oil consumption while complying with IMO Tier III emission limits at all times.
Dependent on the ambient conditions it may be needed to adapt the engine
load during the regeneration phase. and GenSet
```
### 2.3.5 Boundary conditions for SCR operation

```
Please consider following boundary conditions for the SCR operation:
▪ Temperature control of temperature turbine outlet:
```
- By adjustable waste gate (attached to engine).
- Set point 320 °C as minimum temperature for active SCR.
- Set point 290 °C as minimum temperature for deactivated SCR.
▪ Fuel:
- In line with MAN Diesel & Turbo specification, maximum 3.5 % sulfur
content.
▪ SCR active in following range:
- –10 °C (arctic) up to 45 °C (tropic) intake air temperature.
- In the range of 25 % to 100 % engine load.
▪ IMO requirements for handling of SCR operation disturbances:
- In case of SCR malfunction IMO regulations allow that the system will
be turned off and the ship's journey will be continued to the port of
destination. There, the ship needs to be repaired, if the emission lim-
its of the harbor/sea area would be exceeded.
Accordingly, the vessel may leave a port in case it will only sail in
areas requiring IMO II, even if the SCR system is still out of service.
▪ Differential pressure Δp SCR (normal operation):
- Max. 20 mbar.

**2.3 SCR – Special notes**

```
MAN 32/40 IMO Tier III, Project Guide – Marine, EN 25 (451)
```

```
For the design of the complete exhaust gas line, please consider:
▪ Maximum permissible exhaust gas back pressure (to be calculated from
engine turbocharger outlet to end of complete exhaust gas line):
```
- Max. 50 mbar (at 100 % engine load).
▪ Maximum permissible temperature drop of exhaust gas line
( to be calculated as difference of exhaust gas temperature turbine outlet
and temperature SCR inlet):
- Max. 5 K in the range of 25 % to 100 % engine load (calculated at 5
°C air temperature in the engine room).
▪ Recommended for exhaust gas line:
- Insulation according to SOLAS standard.
Note:
The SCR system requires high exhaust gas temperatures for an effective
operation. MAN Diesel & Turbo therefore recommends to arrange the SCR
as the first device in the exhaust gas line, followed by other auxiliaries like
boiler, silencer etc.

### 2.3.6 Performance coverage for SCR system

```
▪ Performance guarantee for engine plus SCR within defined in section
Boundary conditions for SCR operation, Page 25.
▪ Guarantee for engine plus SCR for marine applications to meet IMO
Tier III level as defined by IMO within defined in section Boundary condi-
tions for SCR operation, Page 25
(details will be handled within the relevant contracts).
Please be aware:
All statements in this document refer to MAN Diesel & Turbo SCR systems
only.
MAN Diesel & Turbo can only deliver an IMO Tier III certificate and act as
“Applicant” (within the meaning of the IMO) if the engine plus SCR system is
supplied by MAN Diesel & Turbo.

standard warranty for a single engine will be given. No guarantee regarding
minimum exhaust gas temperature after turbine or emissions after third party
SCR or suitability of the engine in conjunction with a third party SCR system
can be given.
If the engine is supplied without MAN Diesel & Turbo SCR system, no optimi-
sation function within SaCoS can be applied and as maximum exhaust gas
temperature after turbine only will be possible:
▪ 320 °C (25 % load – 100 % load).

Engine equipment for various applications – General description
```
```
If engines are operated at full load at low air intake temperature, the high air
density leads to the danger of excessive charge air pressure and, conse-
quently, to excessive cylinder pressure. In order to avoid such conditions,
part of the charge air is withdrawn downstream (flap 2, cold blow-off) of the
charge air cooler and blown off.
The charge air pipe is connected to the exhaust pipe via a reduced diameter
pipe and a by-pass flap. The flap is closed in normal operation.
At engine load between 20 % and 60 % and at nominal or reduced speed
this charge air by-pass flap is opened to withdraw a part of the charge air
and leads it into the exhaust gas pipe upstream the turbine. The increased
air flow at the turbine results in a higher charge air pressure of the compres-
sor, which leads to an improved operational behavior of the engine. Addi-
tional this flap may be used to avoid surging of the turbocharger.

The waste gate is used to by-pass the turbine of the turbocharger with a part
of the exhaust gas. This leads to a charge air pressure reduction and the
temperature after turbine is increased.
For plants with an SCR catalyst, downstream of the turbine, a minimum
exhaust gas temperature upstream the SCR catalyst is necessary in order to
ensure its proper performance.
In case the temperature downstream the turbine falls below the set minimum
exhaust gas temperature value, the waste gate is opened gradually in order
to blow-off exhaust gas upstream of the turbine until the exhaust gas tem-
perature downstream of the turbine (and thus upstream of the SCR catalyst)
has reached the required level.
```
```
Figure 17: Overview flaps
```
```
The SCR system uses a reduction agent to transform the pollutant NOx into
environmentally friendly nitrogen and water vapour. The MAN Diesel & Turbo
SCR system is capable of complying with the IMO Tier III limits over the entire
range of applications.
The two stage charge air cooler consists of two stages which differ in the
temperature level of the connected water circuits. The charge air is first
cooled by the HT circuit (high temperature stage of the charge air cooler,
engine) and then further cooled down by the LT circuit (low temperature
stage of the charge air cooler, lube oil cooler).
The charge air temperature control CHATCO serves to prevent accumulation
of condensed water in the charge air pipe. In this connection, the charge air
temperature is, depending on the intake air temperature, controlled in such a
way that, assuming a constant relative air humidity of 80 %, the temperature
in the charge air pipe does not fall below the condensation temperature.
Jet Assist for acceleration of the turbocharger is uesd where special
demands exist regarding fast acceleration and/or load application. In such
cases, compressed air from the starting air vessels is reduced to a pressure

of approximately 4 bar before being passed into the compressor casing of
the turbocharger to be admitted to the compressor wheel via inclined bored
passages. In this way, additional air is supplied to the compressor which in
turn is accelerated, thereby increasing the charge air pressure. Operation of
the accelerating system is initiated by a control, and limited to a fixed load
range.
For some engine types with conventional injection a VIT (Variable Injection
Timing) is available allowing a shifting of injection start. A shifting in the direc-
tion of “advanced injection” is supposed to increase the ignition pressure and
thus reduces fuel consumption. Shifting in the direction of “retarded injection”
helps to reduce NOx emissions.
Engines, which are equipped with “slow turn”, are automatically turned prior
to engine start, with the turning process being monitored by the engine con-
trol. If the engine does not reach the expected number of crankshaft revolu-
tions (2.5 revolutions) within a specified period of time, or in case the slow-
turn time is shorter than the programmed minimum slow-turn time, an error
message is issued. This error message serves as an indication that there is
liquid (oil, water, fuel) in the combustion chamber. If the slow-turn manoeuvre
is completed successfully, the engine is started automatically.
Slow turn is always required for plants with power management system
(PMS) demanding automatic engine start.
Bearing damage, piston seizure and blow-by in combustion chamber leads
to increased oil mist formation. As a part of the safety system the oil mist
detector monitors the oil mist concentration in crankcase to indicate these
failures at an early stage.
The splash oil monitoring system is a constituent part of the safety system.
Sensors are used to monitor the temperature of each individual drive unit (or
pair of drive at V engines) indirectly via splash oil.
As an important part of the safety system the temperatures of the crankshaft
main bearings are measured just underneath the bearing shells in the bearing
caps. This is carried out using oil-tight resistance temperature sensors.
For long-term engine operation (more than 72 hours within a two-week
period [cumulative with distribution as required]) with DM-grade fuel a valve
seat lubrication equipment needs to be attached to the engine. By this
equipment, oil is fed dropwise into the inlet channels and thereby lubricates
the inlet valve seats. This generates a damping effect between the sealing
surfaces of the inlet valves (HFO-operation leads to layers on the sealing sur-
faces of the inlet valves with a sufficient damping effect).
For conventional injection pumps provide a sealing oil supply, in long-term
engine operation (more than 72 hours within a two-week period [cumulative
with distribution as required]) with DM-grade fuel. The low viscosity of DM-
grade fuel can cause an increased leakage inside the conventional injection
pump, that may contaminate the lube oil. The sealing oil avoids effectively
contamination of lube oil by separation of fuel and lube oil side within the
conventional fuel injection pumps (not required for CR injection system).
The engine is equipped with starting air valves within some of the cylinder
heads. On starting command, compressed air will be led in a special
sequence into the cylinder and will push down the piston and turn thereby
the crankshaft untill a defined speed is reached.

### 2.6 Increased exhaust gas pressure due to exhaust gas after treatment installations

```
Resulting installation demands
```
```
If the recommended exhaust gas back pressure as stated in section Operat-
ing/service temperatures and pressures, Page 130 cannot be met due to
exhaust gas after treatment installations following limit values need to be
considered.
```
```
Exhaust gas back pressure after turbocharger
Operating pressure Δpexh, standard 0 – 50 mbar
```
```
Operating pressure Δpexh, range with increase of fuel consumption 50 – 80 mbar
```
```
Operating pressure Δpexh, where a customised engine matching is required > 80 mbar
Table 17: Exhaust gas back pressure after turbocharger
```
```

Operating pressure Δpintake, standard 0 – –20 mbar
```
```
Operating pressure Δpintake, range with increase of fuel consumption –20 – –40 mbar
```
```
Operating pressure Δpintake, where a customised engine matching is required < –40 mbar
Table 18: Intake air pressure before turbocharger
```
```
Sum of the exhaust gas back pressure after turbocharger and the absolute value of the intake air pressure before
turbocharger
Operating pressure Δpexh + Abs(Δpintake), standard 0 – 70 mbar
```
```
Operating pressure Δpexh + Abs(Δpintake), range with increase of fuel consumption 70 – 120 mbar
```
```
Operating pressure Δpexh + Abs(Δpintake), where a customised engine matching is required > 120 mbar
Table 19: Sum of the exhaust gas back pressure after turbocharger and the absolute value of the intake air
pressure before turbocharger
```
```
Maximum exhaust gas pressure drop – Layout
▪ Shipyard and supplier of equipment in exhaust gas line have to ensure
that pressure drop Δpexh over entire exhaust gas piping incl. pipe work,
scrubber, boiler, silencer, etc. must stay below stated standard operating
pressure at all operating conditions.
▪ It is recommended to consider an additional 10 mbar for consideration of
aging and possible fouling/staining of the components over lifetime.
▪ A proper dimensioning of the entire flow path including all installed com-
ponents is advised or even the installation of an exhaust gas blower if
necessary.
▪ At the same time the pressure drop Δpintake in the intake air path must be
kept below stated standard operating pressure at all operating conditions
and including aging over lifetime.
▪ For significant overruns in pressure losses even a reduction in the rated
power output may become necessary.

```
▪ On plant side it must be prepared, that pressure sensors directly after
turbine outlet and directly before compressor inlet may be installed to
verify above stated figures.
By-pass for emergency operation
▪ Evaluate if the chosen exhaust gas after treatment installation demands a
by-pass for emergency operation.
▪ For scrubber application, a by-pass is recommended to ensure emer-
gency operation in case that the exhaust gas cannot flow through the
scrubber freely.
▪ The by-pass needs to be dimensioned for the same pressure drop as the
main installation that is by-passed – otherwise the engine would oper-
ated on a differing operating point with negative influence on the per-
formance, e.g. a lower value of the pressure drop may result in too high
turbocharger speeds.
Single streaming per engine recommended/multi-streaming to be evaluated
project specific
▪ In general each engine must be equipped with a separate exhaust gas
line as single streaming installation. This will prevent reciprocal influencing
of the engine as e.g. exhaust gas backflow into an engine out of opera-
tion or within an engine running at very low load (negative pressure drop
over the cylinder can cause exhaust gas back flow into intake manifold
during valve overlap).
▪ In case a multi-streaming solution is realised (i.e. only one combined
scrubber for multiple engines) this needs to be stated on early project
stage. Hereby air/exhaust gas tight flaps need to be provided to safe-
guard engines out of operation. A specific layout of e.g. sealing air mass
flow will be necessary and also a power management may become nec-
essary in order to prevent operation of several engines at very high loads
while others are running on extremely low load. A detailed analysis as
HAZOP study and risk analysis by the yard becomes mandatory.
Engine to be protected from backflow of media out of exhaust gas after
treatment installation
▪ A backflow of e.g. urea, scrubbing water, condensate or even rain from
the exhaust gas after treatment installation towards the engine must be
prevented under all operating conditions and circumstances, including
engine or equipment shutdown and maintenance/repair work.
Turbine cleaning
▪ Both wet and dry turbine cleaning must be possible without causing mal-
functions or performance deterioration of the exhaust system incl. any
installed components such as boiler, scrubber, silencer, etc.
White exhaust plume by water condensation
▪ When a wet scrubber is in operation, a visible exhaust plume has to be
expected under certain conditions. This is not harmful for the environ-
ment. However, countermeasures like reheating and/or a demister
should be considered to prevent condensed water droplets from leaving
the funnel, which would increase visibility of the plume.
▪ The design of the exhaust system including exhaust gas after treatment
installation has to make sure that the exhaust flow has sufficient velocity
in order not to sink down directly onboard the vessel or near to the plant.
At the same time the exhaust pressure drop must not exceed the limit
value.

### 2.8 Low load operation

```
Definition
```
```
Basically, the following load conditions are distinguished:
```
```
Overload: > 100 % of the full load power
Full load: 100 % of the full load power
Part load: < 100 % of the full load power
Low load: < 25 % of the full load power
```
```
The best operating conditions for the engine prevail under even loading in the
range of 60 % to 90 % of full load power.
During idling or engine operation at a low load, combustion in the combus-
tion chamber is incomplete.
This may result in the forming of deposits in the combustion chamber, which
will lead to increased soot emission and to increasing cylinder contamination.
This process is more acute in low load operation and during manoeuvring
when the cooling water temperatures are not kept at the required level, and
are decreasing too rapidly. This may result in too low charge air and com-
bustion chamber temperatures, deteriorating the combustion at low loads
especially in heavy fuel operation.
Based on the above, the low load operation in the range of < 25 % of the full
load is subjected to specific limitations. According to Fig. Time limitations for
low load operation (left), duration of "relieving operation" (right), Page 52
immediately after a phase of low load operation the engine must be operated
at > 70 % of full load for some time in order to reduce the deposits in the
cylinders and the exhaust gas turbocharger again.
▪ There are no restrictions at loads > 25 % of the full load, provided that
the specified engine operating values are not exceeded.
▪ Continuous operation at < 25 % of the full load should be avoided when-
ever possible.
▪ No-load operation, particularly at nominal speed (alternator operation) is
only permissible for one hour maximum.
After 500 hours of continuous operation with liquid fuel, at a low load in the
range of 20 % to 25 % of the full load, the engine must be run-in again.
See section Engine running in, Page 429.

* Generally, the time limits in heavy fuel oil operation apply to all HFO grades according to the des-
ignated fuel specification. In certain rare cases, when HFO grades with a high ignition delay
together with a high coke residues content are used, it may be necessary to raise the total level
of the limiting curve for HFO from 20% up to 30%.

Time limits for low load operation with heavy fuel oil:
At 10 % of the full load, operation on heavy fuel oil is allowable for 19 hours
maximum.
Duration of "relieving operation":
Let the engine run at a load > 70 % of the full load appr. within 1.2 hours to
burn the deposits formed.
Note:
The acceleration time from the actual load up to 70 % of the full load must
be at least 15 minutes.

### 2.9 Start up and load application

### 2.9.1 General remarks

```
In the case of highly supercharged engines, load application is limited. This is
due to the fact that the charge-air pressure build-up is delayed by the turbo-
charger run-up. Besides, a low load application promotes uniform heating of
the engine.
In general, requirements of the International Association of Classification
Societies (IACS) and of ISO 8528-5 are valid.
According to performance grade G2 concerning:
▪ Dynamic speed drop in % of the nominal speed ≤ 10 %
▪ Remaining speed variation in % of the nominal speed: ≤ 5 %
▪ Recovery time until reaching the tolerance band ±1 % of nominal speed:
≤ 5 seconds
Clarify any higher project-specific requirements at an early project stage with
MAN Diesel & Turbo. They must be part of the contract.
In a load drop of 100 % nominal engine power, the dynamic speed variation
must not exceed:
▪ 10 % of the nominal speed
▪ the remaining speed variation must not surpass 5 % of the nominal
speed
To limit the effort regarding regulating the media circuits, also to ensure an
uniform heat input it always should be aimed for longer load application times
by taking into account the realistic requirements of the specific plant.
All questions regarding the dynamic behaviour should be clarified in close
cooperation between the customer and MAN Diesel & Turbo at an early
project stage.
Requirements for plant design:
▪ The load application behaviour must be considered in the electrical sys-
tem design of the plant.
▪ The system operation must be safe in case of graduated load applica-
tion.
▪ The load application conditions (E-balance) must be approved during the
planning and examination phase.
▪ The possible failure of one engine must be considered, see section Gen-
erator operation/electric propulsion – Power management, Page 72.
```
### 2.9.2 Start up time

```
Prior to the start up of the engine it must be ensured that the emergency
stop of the engine is working properly. Additionally all required supply sys-
tems must be in operation or in standby operation.
For the start up of the engine it needs to be preheated:
▪ Lube oil temperature ≥ 40 °C

```
▪ Cooling water temperature ≥ 60 °C
The required start up time in normal starting mode (preheated engine), with
the required time for start up lube oil system and prelubrication of the engine
is shown in figure below.
▪ Distillate fuel must be used until warming up phase is completed.
Before further use of the engine a warming up phase is required to reach at
least the level of the regular preheating temperatures (lube oil temperature
> 40 °C, cooling water temperature > 60 °C), see figure below.
```
```
Figure 19: Start up time (not stand-by mode) for preheated engine and cold engine (emergency case)

```
For engines in stand-by mode the required start up time is shortened
accordingly to figure below. Engines in stand-by mode can be started with
normal starting procedure at any time.

capability of the engine, so exhaust gas will be visible (opacity > 60 %). The
shortest possible run up time can only be achieved with Jet Assist.
Note:
Emergency start up only can be applied if following is provided:
▪ Engine to be equipped with Jet Assist.
▪ External signal from plant to be provided for request to SaCoS for emer-
gency start up.

```
Relevance of the specific starting phases depends on the application and on
layout of the specific plant.
Specified minimum run up time is based on the value "Required minimum
total moment of inertia" in the table(s) in section Moments of inertia – Crank-
shaft, damper, flywheel, Page 155. If the moment of inertia of the GenSet is
higher as the stated value in that table, then also the run-up time is extended
accordingly.
```
### 2.9.3 Load application – Cold engine (emergency case)

```
If the cold engine has been started and runs at nominal speed as prescribed
following procedure is relevant:
▪ Distillate fuel must be used until warming up phase is completed.
▪ Loading the engine gradually up to 30 % engine load within 6 to 8
minutes.
▪ Keep the load at 30 % during the warming up phase until oil temperature
> 40 °C and cooling water temperature > 60 °C are reached.
The necessary time span for this process depends on the actual media tem-
peratures and the specific design of the plant. After these prescribed media
temperatures are reached the engine can be loaded up according the dia-
gram for a preheated engine.

```
## 2.9.4 Load application for electric propulsion/auxiliary GenSet

```
In general it is recommended to apply the load according to curve "Normal
loading" – see figure below. This ensures uniform heat input to the engine
and exhaust gas below the limit of visibility (opacity below 10 %). Jet Assist is
not required in this case.
Even after the engine has reached normal engine operating temperatures it is
recommended to apply the load according to curve "Normal loading". Jet
Assist is not required in this case. Even for "Short loading" no Jet Assist is
required. Load application according the "Short loading" curve may be affec-
ted by visible exhaust gas (opacity up to 30 %).
"Emergency loading" is the shortest possible load application time for contin-

For this purpose, the power management system should have an own emer-

that this is near to the maximum capability of the engine, so exhaust gas will
be visible. The shortest possible load application time can only be achieved

## 2.9.5 Load application – Load steps (for electric propulsion)

```
The specification of the IACS (Unified Requirement M3) contains first of all
guidelines for suddenly applied load steps. Originally two load steps, each
50 %, were described. In view of the technical progress regarding increasing
mean effective pressures, the requirements were adapted. According to
IACS and ISO 8528-5 following diagram is used to define – based on the
mean effective pressure of the respective engine – the load steps for a load
application from 0 % load to 100 % load. This diagram serves as a guideline
for four stroke engines in general and is reflected in the rules of the classifica-
tion societies.
Please be aware, that for marine engines load application requirements must
be clarified with the respective classification society as well as with the ship-
yard and the owner.

If the engine has reached normal operating temperature, load steps can be
applied according to the diagram below. The load step has to be chosen
depending on the desired recovery time. These curves are for engine plus
standard generator – plant specific details and additional moments of inertia
need to be considered. If low opacity values (below 30 % opacity) are
required, load steps should be maximum 20 % (without Jet Assist), maxi-
mum 25 % (with Jet Assist).
Before an additional load step will be applied, at least 20 sec. waiting time
after initiation of the previous load step needs to be considered.
After nominal speed is reached and synchronisation is done, the load appli-
cation process is visualised in the following diagrams.

## 2.9.6 Load application for mechanical propulsion (FPP and CPP)

```
Acceleration times for fixed pitch and controllable pitch propeller plants
```
```
Stated acceleration times in the following figure are valid for the engine itself.
Depending on the project specific propulsion train (moments of inertia, vibra-
tion calculation etc.) project specific this may differ. Of course, the accelera-
tion times are not valid for the ship itself, due to the fact, that the time con-
stants for the dynamic behavior of the engine and the vessel may have a
ratio of up to 1:100, or even higher (dependent on the type of vessel). The
effect on the vessel must be calculated separately.
For remote controlled propeller drives for ships with unmanned or centrally
monitored engine room operation in accordance to IACS “Requirements
concerning MACHINERY INSTALLATIONS”, M43, a single control device for
each independent propeller has to be provided, with automatic performance
preventing overload and prolonged running in critical speed ranges of the
propelling machinery. Operation of the engine according to the relevant and
specific operating range (e.g. Operating range for controllable pitch propeller
(CPP)) has to be ensured. In case of a manned engine room and manual
operation of the propulsion drive, the engine room personnel are responsible
for the soft loading sequence, before control is handed over to the bridge.
If the direction of the drive shaft is to be changed during maneuvering
(applies in particular to fixed pitch propeller plants) the resulting jolt, the pos-
sibility of wind milling and operation in the permitted operating range of the
engine needs to be considered. It should be aimed for the lowest possible
rotational speed of the propeller shaft, when the rotation direction change is
initiated. Already in the project planning and design phase the installation of a
shaft brake should be considered.
The lower time limits for normal and emergency manoeuvres are given in our
diagrams for application and shedding of load. We strongly recommend that
the limits for normal manoeuvring are observed during normal operation. An
automatic change-over to a shortened load programme is required for emer-
gency manoeuvres. The final design of the programme should be jointly
determined by all the parties involved, considering the demands for manoeu-
vring and the actual service capacity.

## 2.10 Engine load reduction

```
Sudden load shedding
```
```
For the sudden load shedding from 100 % to 0 % engine load, several
requirements of the classification societies regarding the dynamic and per-
manent change of engine speed have to be fulfilled.
In case of a sudden load shedding and related compressor surging, check
the proper function of the turbocharger silencer filter mat.
```
```
Recommended load reduction/stopping the engine
```
```
Figure Engine ramping down, generally, Page 66, shows the shortest pos-
sible times for continuously ramping down the engine and a sudden load
shedding.
To limit the effort regarding regulating the media circuits and also to ensure
an uniform heat dissipation it always should be aimed for longer ramping
down times by taking into account the realistic requirements of the specific
plant.
Before final engine stop the engine has to be operated for a minimum of
1 min. at idling speed.
```
```
Run-down cooling
```
```
In order to dissipate the residual engine heat, the system circuits should be
kept in operation after final engine stop for a minimum of 15 min.

## 2.11 Engine load reduction as a protective safety measure

```
Requirements for the power management system/propeller control
```
```
In case of a load reduction request due to predefined abnormal engine
parameter (e.g. high exhaust gas temperature, high turbine speed, high lube
oil temperature) the power output (load) must be ramped down as fast as
possible to ≤ 60 % load.
Therefore the power management system/propeller control has to meet the
following requirements:
▪ After a maximum of 5 seconds after occurrence of the load reduction
signal, the engine load must be reduced by at least 5 %.
▪ Then, within the next time period of maximum 30 sec. an additional
reduction of engine load by at least 35 % needs to be applied.
▪ The “prohibited range” shown in figure Engine load reduction as a pro-
tective safety measure, Page 66 has to be avoided.
```
```

## 2.12 Engine operation under arctic conditions

```
Arctic condition is defined as:
Air intake temperatures of the engine below +5 °C
```

66 (451) MAN 32/40 IMO Tier III, Project Guide – Marine, EN


```
If engines operate under arctic conditions (intermittently or permanently), the
engine equipment and plant installation have to hold certain design features
and meet special requirements. They depend on the possible minimum air
intake temperature of the engine and the specification of the fuel used.
Minimum air intake temperature of the engine, tx:
▪ Category A
+5 °C > tx > −15 °C
▪ Category B
–15 °C ≥ tx > −35 °C
▪ Category C
tx ≤ −35 °C
```
```
Special engine design requirements
```
```
▪ Charge air blow-off according to categories A, B or C.
▪ If arctic fuel (with very low lubricating properties) is used, the following
actions are required:
```
- The maximum permissible fuel temperatures and the minimum per-
    missible viscosity before engine have to be kept.
- Fuel injection pump with sealing oil
    The low viscosity of the arctic fuel can cause an increased leakage
    inside conventional injection pumps, that may contaminate the lube
    oil. Therefore sealing oil needs to be installed at the engine and must
    be activated (dependent on engine type).
- Fuel injection valve
    Switch off nozzle cooling to avoid corrosion caused by temperatures
    below the dew point.
- Valve seat lubrication
    Has to be equipped to the engine and to be activated to avoid
    increased wear of the inlet valves (dependent on engine type).

```
Engine equipment
```
```
▪ SaCoSone equipment is suitable to be stored at minimum ambient tem-
peratures of –15 °C.
▪ In case these conditions cannot be met, protective measures against cli-
matic influences have to be taken for the following electronic compo-
nents:
```
- EDS Databox APC620
- TFT-touchscreen
- Emergency switch module BD5937
These components have to be stored at places, where the temperature
is above –15 °C.
▪ A minimum operating temperature of ≥ 0 °C has to be ensured. The use
of an optional electric heating is recommended.

```
Plant installation
▪ Air intake of the engine and power house/engine room ventilation have to
be two different systems to ensure that the power house/engine room
temperature is not too low caused by the ambient air temperature.
▪ It is necessary to ensure that the charge air cooler cannot freeze when
the engine is out of operation (and the cold air is at the air inlet side).
▪ Category A, B
No additional actions are necessary. The charge air before the cylinder is
preheated by the HT circuit of the charge air cooler (LT circuit closed).
▪ Category C
An air intake temperature ≥ –35 °C has to be ensured by preheating.
Additionally the charge air before the cylinder is preheated by the HT cir-
cuit of the charge air cooler (LT circuit closed).
▪ In general the minimum viscosity before engine of 1.9 cSt must not be
undershoot.
▪ The fuel specific characteristic values “pour point” and “cold filter plug-
ging point” have to be observed to ensure pumpability respectively filter-
ability of the fuel oil.
▪ Fuel temperatures of ≤ –10 °C are to be avoided, due to temporarily
embrittlement of seals used in the engines fuel oil system. As a result
they may suffer a loss of function.
▪ Ventilation of power house/engine room.
The air of the power house/engine room ventilation must not be too cold
(preheating is necessary) to avoid the freezing of the liquids in the power
house/engine room systems.
▪ Minimum powerhouse/engine room temperature for design ≥ +5 °C.
▪ Coolant and lube oil system have to be preheated for each individual
engine, see section Starting conditions, Page 50.
▪ Design requirements for the preheater of HT systems:
```
- Category A
    Standard preheater
- Category B
    50 % increased capacity of the preheater
- Category C
    100 % increased capacity of the preheater
▪ Maximum permissible antifreeze concentration (ethylene glycol) in the
engine cooling water.
An increasing proportion of antifreeze decreases the specific heat
capacity of the engine cooling water, which worsens the heat dissipation
from the engine and will lead to higher component temperatures.
The antifreeze concentration of the engine cooling water systems (HT
and NT) within the engine room respectively power house is therefore
limited to a maximum concentration of 40 % glycol. For systems that
require more than 40 % glycol in the cooling water an intermediate heat
exchanger with a low terminal temperature difference should be provi-
ded, which separates the external cooling water system from the internal
system (engine cooling water).
▪ If a concentration of anti-freezing agents of > 50 % in the cooling water
systems is required, contact MAN Diesel & Turbo for approval.

▪ For information regarding engine cooling water see section Specification
for engine supplies, Page 221.
The design of the insulation of the piping systems and other plant parts
(tanks, heat exchanger etc.) has to be modified and designed for the special
requirements of arctic conditions.
To support the restart procedures in cold condition (e.g. after unmanned sur-
vival mode during winter), it is recommended to install a heat tracing system
in the pipelines to the engine.
Note:
A preheating of the lube oil has to be ensured. If the plant is not equipped
with a lube oil separator (e.g. plants only operating on MGO) alternative
equipment for preheating of the lube oil must be provided.
For plants taken out of operation and cooled down below temperatures of
+5 °C additional special measures are required – in this case contact MAN
Diesel & Turbo.
```
```
Minimum load
```
```
The minimum engine load corresponds to the current intake air temperature
at compressor inlet (TC) and prevents too high heat loss and the resulting
risk of engine damage.
After engine start it is necessary to ramp up the engine to the below speci-
fied minimum engine load. Thereby Range I and Range II must be passed as
quick as possible to reach Range III. Be aware that within Range III low load
operation restrictions may apply.
All preheaters need to be operated in parallel to engine operation during
startup until minimum engine load is reached to ensure at least the standby
conditions of the media temperatures.

## 2.13.2 Available outputs and permissible frequency deviations

```
General
```

severity of the frequency fluctuations, output and operation respectively have
to be restricted.
```
```
Frequency adjustment range

```
```
Operating range
```
```
Depending on the prevailing local ambient conditions, a certain maximum
continuous rating will be available.
In the output/speed and frequency diagrams, a range has specifically been
marked with “No continuous operation permissible in this area”. Operation in
this range is only permissible for a short period of time, i.e. for less than 2
minutes. In special cases, a continuous rating is permissible if the standard
frequency is exceeded by more than 4 %.
```
```
Limiting parameters
```
```
In case the frequency decreases, the available output is limited by the maxi-
mum permissible torque of the generating set.
An increase in frequency, resulting in a speed that is higher than the maxi-
mum speed admissible for continuous operation, is only permissible for a
short period of time, i.e. for less than 2 minutes.

## 2.13.3 Generator operation/electric propulsion – Power management

```
Operation of vessels with electric propulsion is defined as parallel operation
of main engines with generators forming a closed system.
The power supply of the plant as a standard is done by auxilliary GenSets
also forming a closed system.
In the design/layout of the plant a possible failure of one engine has to be
considered in order to avoid overloading and under-frequency of the remain-
ing engines with the risk of an electrical blackout.
Therefore we recommend to install a power management system. This
ensures uninterrupted operation in the maximum output range and in case
one engine fails the power management system reduces the propulsive out-
put or switches off less important energy consumers in order to avoid under-
frequency.
According to the operating conditions it is the responsibility of the ship's
operator to set priorities and to decide which energy consumer has to be
switched off.
The base load should be chosen as high as possible to achieve an optimum
engine operation and lowest soot emissions.
The optimum operating range and the permissible part loads are to be
observed (see section Low load operation, Page 52).

Load application in case one engine fails
```
```
In case one engine fails, its output has to be made up for by the remaining
engines in the system and/or the load has to be decreased by reducing the
propulsive output and/or by switching off electrical consumers.
The immediate load transfer to one engine does not always correspond with
the load reserve that the particular engine has available at the respective
moment. That depends on the engine's base load.
Be aware that the following section only serves as an example and is defi-
nitely not valid for this engine type. For the engine specific capability please
see figure Load application by load steps – Speed drop and recovery time.
```
```

```
```
Based on the above stated exemplary figure and on the total number of
engines in operation the recommended maxium load of these engines can
be derived. Observing this limiting maximum load ensures that the load from
one failed engine can be transferred to the remaining engines in operation
without power reduction.

## 2.13.4 Alternator – Reverse power protection

```
Definition of reverse power
```
```
If an alternator, coupled to a combustion engine, is no longer driven by this
engine, but is supplied with propulsive power by the connected electric grid
and operates as an electric motor instead of working as an alternator, this is
called reverse power. The speed of a reverse power driven engine is accord-
ingly to the grid frequency and the rated engine speed.

```

```
Demand for reverse power protection
```
```
For each alternator (arranged for parallel operation) a reverse power protec-
tion device has to be provided because if a stopped combustion engine (fuel
admission at zero) is being turned it can cause, due to poor lubrication,
excessive wear on the engine ́s bearings. This is also a classifications’
requirement.
```
```
Examples for possible reverse power occurences
```
```
▪ Due to lack of fuel the combustion engine no longer drives the alternator,
which is still connected to the mains.
▪ Stopping of the combustion engine while the driven alternator is still con-
nected to the electric grid.
▪ On ships with electric drive the propeller can also drive the electric trac-
tion motor and this in turn drives the alternator and the alternator drives
the connected combustion engine.
▪ Sudden frequency increase, e.g. because of a load decrease in an isola-
ted electrical system -> if the combustion engine is operated at low load
(e.g. just after synchronising).
```
```
Adjusting the reverse power protection relay
```
```
The necessary power to drive an unfired diesel or gas engine at nominal
speed cannot exceed the power which is necessary to overcome the internal
friction of the engine. This power is called motoring power. The setting of the
reverse-power relay should be, as stated in the classification rules, 50 % of
the motoring power. To avoid false tripping of the alternator circuit breaker a
time delay has to be implemented. A reverse power >> 6 % mostly indicates
serious disturbances in the generator operation.
Table Adjusting the reverse power relay, Page 74 below provides a sum-
mary.
```
```

## 2.13.5 Earthing measures of diesel engines and bearing insulation on alternators

```
General
```
```
The use of electrical equipment on diesel engines requires precautions to be
taken for protection against shock current and for equipotential bonding.
These measures not only serve as shock protection but also for functional
protection of electric and electronic devices (EMC protection, device protec-
tion in case of welding, etc.).

Earthing connections on the engine
```
```
Threaded bores M12, 20 mm deep, marked with the earthing symbol are
provided in the engine foot on both ends of the engine.
It has to be ensured that earthing is carried out immediately after engine set-
up. If this cannot be accomplished any other way, at least provisional earth-
ing is to be effected right after engine set-up.

Measures to be taken on the alternator
```
```
Shaft voltages, i.e. voltages between the two shaft ends, are generated in
electrical machines because of slight magnetic unbalances and ring excita-
tions. In the case of considerable shaft voltages (e.g. > 0.3 V), there is the
risk that bearing damage occurs due to current transfers. For this reason, at
least the bearing that is not located on the drive end is insulated (valid for
alternators > 1 MW output). For verification, the voltage available at the shaft
(shaft voltage) is measured while the alternator is running and excited. With
proper insulation, a voltage can be measured. In order to protect the prime
mover and to divert electrostatic charging, an earthing brush is often fitted on
the coupling side.
Observation of the required measures is the alternator manufacturer’s
responsibility.
```
```
Consequences of inadequate bearing insulation on the alternator and
insulation check
```
```
In case the bearing insulation is inadequate, e.g., if the bearing insulation was
short-circuited by a measuring lead (PT100, vibration sensor), leakage cur-
rents may occur, which result in the destruction of the bearings. One possi-

bility to check the insulation with the alternator at standstill (prior to coupling
the alternator to the engine; this, however, is only possible in the case of sin-
gle-bearing alternators) would be:
▪ Raise the alternator rotor (insulated, in the crane) on the coupling side.
▪ Measure the insulation by means of the megger test against earth.
Note:
Hereby the max. voltage permitted by the alternator manufacturer is to be
observed.
If the shaft voltage of the alternator at rated speed and rated voltage is
known (e.g. from the test record of the alternator acceptance test), it is also
possible to carry out a comparative measurement.
If the measured shaft voltage is lower than the result of the “earlier measure-
ment” (test record), the alternator manufacturer should be consulted.
```
```
Earthing conductor
```
```
The nominal cross section of the earthing conductor (equipotential bonding
conductor) has to be selected in accordance with DIN VDE 0100, part 540
(up to 1 kV) or DIN VDE 0141 (in excess of 1 kV).
Generally, the following applies:
The protective conductor to be assigned to the largest main conductor is to
be taken as a basis for sizing the cross sections of the equipotential bonding
conductors.
Flexible conductors have to be used for the connection of resiliently mounted
engines.
```
```
Execution of earthing
```
```
The earthing must be executed by the shipyard respectively plant owner,
since generally it is not scope of supply of MAN Diesel & Turbo.
Earthing strips are not included in the MAN Diesel & Turbo scope of supply.
```
```
Additional information regarding the use of welding equipment
```
```
In order to prevent damage on electrical components, it is imperative to earth
welding equipment close to the welding area, i.e., the distance between the
welding electrode and the earthing connection should not exceed 10 m.

Remark:
In rare occasions it might be necessary that certain engine speed intervals

For FPP applications as well as for applications using resiliently mounted
engines, the admissible engine speed range has to be confirmed (preferably
at an early project phase) by a torsional vibration calculation, by a dimension-
ing of the resilient mounting, and, if necessary, by an engine operational
vibration calculation.

## 2.14.3 General requirements for the CPP propulsion control

```
Pitch control of the propeller plant
```
```
A distinction between constant-speed operation and combinator-curve oper-
ation has to be ensured.
Failure of propeller pitch control:
In order to avoid overloading of the engine upon failure of the propeller pitch
control the propeller pitch must be adjusted to a value < 60 % of the maxi-
mum possible pitch.
As a load indication a 4 – 20 mA signal from the engine control is supplied to
the propeller control.
Combinator-curve operation:
The 4 – 20 mA signal has to be used for the assignment of the propeller
pitch to the respective engine speed. The operation curve of engine speed
and propeller pitch (for power range, see section Operating range for control-
lable pitch propeller (CPP), Page 78) has to be observed also during acceler-
ation/load increase and unloading.
```
```
Acceleration/load increase
```
```
The engine speed has to be increased prior to increasing the propeller pitch
(see figure Example to illustrate the change from one load step to another,
Page 80.
When increasing propeller pitch and engine speed synchronously, the speed
has to be increased faster than the propeller pitch.
The engine should not be operated in the area above the combinator curve
(Range II in figure Operating range for controllable pitch propeller, Page 78).
Automatic limitation of the rate of load increase must be implemented in the
propulsion control.
```
```
Deceleration/unloading the engine
```
```
The engine speed has to be reduced later than the propeller pitch (see figure
Example to illustrate the change from one load step to another, Page 80.
When decreasing propeller pitch and engine speed synchronously, the pro-
peller pitch has to be decreased faster than the speed.
The engine should not be operated in the area above the combinator curve
(Range II in figure Operating range for controllable pitch propeller, Page 78).

Windmilling protection
```
```
If a stopped engine (fuel admission at zero) is being turned by the propeller,
this is called “windmilling”. The permissible period for windmilling is short,
because windmilling can cause excessive wear of the engine bearings, due
to poor lubrication at low propeller speed.
The propeller control has to ensure that the windmilling time is less than
40 sec.
The propeller control has to ensure that the windmilling time is less than
40 sec. In case of plants without shifting clutch, it has to be ensured that a
stopped engine cannot be turned by the propeller.
For maintenance work a shaft interlock has to be provided for each propeller
shaft.

Binary signals from engine control
```
```
The overload contact will be activated when the engine's fuel admission rea-
ches the maximum position. At this position, the control system has to stop
the increase of the propeller pitch. If this signal remains longer than the pre-
determined time limit, the propeller pitch has to be decreased.
This contact is activated when the engine is operated close to a limit curve
(torque limiter, charge air pressure limiter, etc.). When the contact is activa-
ted, the control system has to stop the increase of the propeller pitch. If this
signal remains longer than the predetermined time limit, the propeller pitch
has to be decreased.
This contact is activated when disturbances in engine operation occur, for
example too high exhaust-gas mean-value deviation. When the contact is
activated, the propeller control system has to reduce the propeller pitch to
60 % of the rated engine output, without change in engine speed.
In section Engine load reduction as a protective safety measure, Page 66 the
requirements for the response time are stated.
```
```
Distinction between normal manoeuvre and emergency manoeuvre
```
```
The propeller control system has to be able to distinguish between normal
manoeuvre and emergency manoeuvre (i.e., two different acceleration curves
are necessary).
```
```
MAN Diesel & Turbo's guidelines concerning acceleration times and power
range have to be observed
```
```
The power range (see section Operating range for controllable-pitch propeller
(CPP), Page 78) and the acceleration times (see section Load application for
mechanical propulsion (FPP and CPP), Page 63) have to be observed. In

3) Torque limit curve
This curve corresponds to the maximum permitted overload.
4) Maximum permitted engine output after load reduction demand of engine

Within the section Load application for mechanical propulsion (FPP and
CPP), Page 63 acceleration times for fixed pitch propeller plants are stated.
Pay attention to the note regarding consideration of a shaft brake.
Note:
Engine operation in a speed range between 103 % and 106 % is permissible
for maximum 1 hour!
The propeller design depends on type and application of the vessel. There-
fore the determination of the installed propulsive power in the ship is always
the exclusive responsibility of the yard.
Determining the engine power: The energy demand or the energy losses
from all at the engine additionally attached aggregates has to be considered
(e. g. shaft alternators, gearboxes). That means, after deduction of their
energy demand from the engine power the remaining engine power must be
sufficient for the required propulsion power.
Note:
Type testing of the engines is carried out at 110 % rated output and 103 %
rated engine speed.
But operation with output > 100 % only allowed at seatrial for approval of
classification society, not for normal operation.
External HT cooling water support pump and external lubrication support
pump need to be activated within a certain speed range. See section

## 2.15.6 Recalculation of fuel consumption dependent on ambient conditions

```
In accordance to ISO standard ISO 3046-1:2002 "Reciprocating internal
combustion engines – Performance, Part 1: Declarations of power, fuel and
lube oil consumptions, and test methods – Additional requirements for
engines for general use" MAN Diesel & Turbo has specified the method for
recalculation of fuel consumption for liquid fuel dependent on ambient condi-
tions for single-stage turbocharged engines as follows:
```
```
β = 1 + 0.0006 x (tx – tr) + 0.0004 x (tbax – tbar) + 0.07 x (pr – px)
```
```
The formula is valid within the following limits:
Ambient air temperature 5 °C – 55 °C
Charge air temperature before cylinder 25 °C – 75 °C
Ambient air pressure 0.885 bar – 1.030 bar

## 2.15.7 Influence of engine aging on fuel consumption

The fuel oil consumption will increase over the running time of the engine.
Timely service can reduce or eliminate this increase. For dependencies see

2.24 Venting amount of crankcase and turbocharger
A ventilation of the engine crankcase and the turbochargers is required, as
described in section Crankcase vent and tank vent, Page 296.
For the layout of the ventilation system guidance is provided below:
Due to normal blow-by of the piston ring package small amounts of combus-
tion chamber gases get into the crankcase and carry along oil dust.
▪ The amount of crankcase vent gases is approximately 0.1 % of the
engine ́s air flow rate.
▪ The temperature of the crankcase vent gases is approximately 5 K higher
than the oil temperature at the engine ́s oil inlet.
▪ The density of crankcase vent gases is 1.0 kg/m³ (assumption for calcu-
lation).
In addition, the sealing air of the turbocharger needs to be vented.
▪ The amount of turbocharger sealing air is approximately 0.2 % of the
engine ́s air flow rate.
▪ The temperature of turbocharger sealing air is approximately 5 K higher
than the oil temperature at the engine ́s oil inlet.
▪ The density of turbocharger sealing air is 1.0 kg/m³ (assumption for cal-
culation).

**2.26.4 Noise and vibration – Impact on foundation**

```
Noise and vibration is emitted by the engine to the surrounding (see figure
Noise and vibration – Impact on foundation, Page 148). The engine impact
transferred through the engine mounting to the foundation is focussed sub-
sequently.
```
```
Figure 51: Noise and vibration – Impact on foundation
The foundation is excited to vibrations in a wide frequency range by the
engine and by auxiliary equipment (from engine or plant). The engine is
vibrating as a rigid body. Additionally, elastic engine vibrations are superim-
posed. Elastic vibrations are either of global (e.g. complete engine bending)
or local (e.g. bending engine foot) character. If the higher frequency range is
involved, the term "structure borne noise" is used instead of "vibrations".
Mechanical engine vibrations are mainly caused by mass forces of moved
drive train components and by gas forces of the combustion process. For
structure borne noise, further excitations are relevant as well, e.g. impacts
from piston stroke and valve seating, impulsive gas force components, alter-
nating gear train meshing forces and excitations from pumps.
For the analysis of the engine noise- and vibration-impact on the surround-
ing, the complete system with engine, engine mounting, foundation and plant
has to be considered.
Engine related noise and vibration reduction measures cover e.g. counterbal-
ance weights, balancing, crankshaft design with firing sequence, component
design etc. The remaining, inevitable engine excitation is transmitted to the
surrounding of the engine – but not completely in case of a resilient engine
mounting, which is chosen according to the application-specific require-
ments. The resilient mounting isolates engine noise and vibration from its sur-
```

**2.26 Noise**

```
rounding to a large extend. Hence, the transmitted forces are considerably
reduced compared with a rigid mounting. Nevertheless, the engine itself is
vibrating stronger in the low frequency range in general – especially when
driving through mounting resonances.
In order to avoid resonances, it must be ensured that eigenfrequencies of
foundation and coupled plant structures have a sufficient safety margin in
relation to the engine excitations. Moreover, the foundation has to be
designed as stiff as possible in all directions at the connections to the engine.
Thus, the foundation mobility (measured according to ISO 7262) has to be as
low as possible to ensure low structure borne noise levels. For low frequen-
cies, the global connection of the foundation with the plant is focused for that
matter. The dynamic vibration behaviour of the foundation is mostly essential
for the mid frequency range. In the high frequency range, the foundation
elasticity is mainly influenced by the local design at the engine mounts. E.g.
for steel foundations, sufficient wall thicknesses and stiffening ribs at the con-
nection positions shall be provided. The dimensioning of the engine founda-
tion also has to be adjusted to other parts of the plant. For instance, it has to
be avoided that engine vibrations are amplified by alternator foundation vibra-
tions. Due to the scope of supply, the foundation design and its connection
with the plant is mostly within the responsibility of the costumer. Therefore,
the customer is responsible to involve MAN Diesel & Turbo for consultancy in
case of system-related questions with interaction of engine, foundation and
plant. The following information is available for MAN Diesel & Turbo custom-
ers, some on special request:
▪ Residual external forces and couples (Project Guide)
Resulting from the summation of all mass forces from the moving drive
train components. All engine components are considered rigidly in the
calculation. The residual external forces and couples are only transferred
completely to the foundation in case of a rigid mounting, see above.
▪ Static torque fluctuation (Project Guide)
Static torque fluctuations result from the summation of gas and mass
forces acting on the crank drive. All components are considered rigidly in
the calculation. These couples are acting on the foundation dependent
on the applied engine mounting, see above.
▪ Mounting forces (project-specific)
The mounting dimensioning calculation is specific to a project and
defines details of the engine mounting. Mounting forces acting on the
foundation are part of the calculation results. Gas and mass forces are
considered for the excitation. The engine is considered as one rigid body
with elastic mounts. Thus, elastic engine vibrations are not implemented.
▪ Reference measurements for engine crankcase vibrations according to
ISO 10816‑6 (project-specific)
▪ Reference testbed measurements for structure borne noise (project-spe-
cific)
Measuring points are positioned according to ISO 13332 on the engine
feet above and below the mounting elements. Structure borne noise lev-
els above elastic mounts mainly depend on the engine itself. Whereas
structure borne noise levels below elastic mounts strongly depend on the
foundation design. A direct transfer of the results from the testbed foun-
dation to the plant foundation is not easily possible – even with the con-
sideration of testbed mobilities. The results of testbed foundation mobility
measurements according to ISO 7626 are available as a reference on
request as well.

▪ Dynamic transfer stiffness properties of resilient mounts (supplier infor-
mation, project-specific)
Beside the described interaction of engine, foundation and plant with transfer
through the engine mounting to the foundation, additional transfer paths
need to be considered. For instance with focus on the elastic coupling of the
drive train, the exhaust pipe, other pipes and supports etc. Besides the
engine, other sources of noise and vibration need to be considered as well
(e.g. auxiliary equipment, propeller, thruster).
```
**2.27 Vibration**

## 2.27.1 Torsional vibrations

```
Data required for torsional vibration calculation
```
```
MAN Diesel & Turbo calculates the torsional vibrations behaviour for each
individual engine plant of their supply to determine the location and severity
of resonance points. If necessary, appropriate measures will be taken to
avoid excessive stresses due to torsional vibration. These investigations
cover the ideal normal operation of the engine (all cylinders are firing equally)
as well as the simulated emergency operation (misfiring of the cylinder exert-
ing the greatest influence on vibrations, acting against compression). Besides
the natural frequencies and the modes also the dynamic response will be
calculated, normally under consideration of the 1st to 24th harmonic of the
gas and mass forces of the engine.
Beyond that also further exciting sources such as propeller, pumps etc. can
be considered if the respective manufacturer is able to make the corre-
sponding data available to MAN Diesel & Turbo.
If necessary, a torsional vibration calculation will be worked out which can be
submitted for approval to a classification society or a legal authority.
To carry out the torsional vibration calculation following particulars and/or
documents are required.

Note:
Masses which are connected downstream of the engine in the case of an

bending stress, which is mirrored in a measured web deflection during
engine installation.
Provided the limit values for the masses to be coupled downstream of the
engine (permissible values for Mmax and F1max) are complied with, the permit-
ted web deflections will not be exceeded during assembly.
Observing these values ensures a sufficiently long operating time before a
realignment of the crankshaft has to be carried out.

## 2.29.3 Static torque fluctuation

```
General
```
```
The static torque fluctuation is the summation of the torques acting at all
cranks around the crankshaft axis taking into account the correct phase-
angles. These torques are created by the gas and mass forces acting at the
crankpins, with the crank radius being used as the lever. An rigid crankshaft
is assumed.
The values Tmax. and Tmin. listed in the following table(s) represent a measure
for the reaction forces of the engine. The reaction forces generated by the
torque fluctuation are dependent on speed and cylinder number and give a
contribution to the excitations transmitted into the foundation see figure
Static torque fluctuation, Page 159 and the table(s) in this section. Accord-
ing to different mountings these forces are reduced.
In order to avoid local vibration excitations in the vessel, it must be ensured
that the natural frequencies of important part structures (e.g. panels, bulk-
heads, tank walls and decks, equipment and its foundation, pipe systems)
have a sufficient safety margin (if possible ±30 %) in relation to all engine
excitation frequencies.

## 2.32 Foundation

## 2.32.1 General requirements for engine foundation

```
Plate thicknesses
```
```
The stated material dimensions are recommendations, calculated for steel
plates. Thicknesses smaller than these are not permissible. When using other
materials (e.g. aluminium), a sufficient margin has to be added.
```
```
Top plates
```
```
Before or after having been welded in place, the bearing surfaces should be
machined and freed from rolling scale. Surface finish corresponding to Ra
3.2 peak-to-valley roughness in the area of the chocks shall be accom-
plished.
The thickness given is the finished size after machining.
Downward inclination outwards, not exceeding 0.7 %.
Prior to fitting the chocks, clean the bearing surfaces from dirt and rust that
may have formed: After the drilling of the foundation bolt holes, spotface the
lower contact face normal to the bolt hole.
```
```
Foundation girders
```
```
The distance of the inner girders must be observed. We recommend that the
distance of the outer girders (only required for larger types) is observed as
well.
The girders must be aligned exactly above and underneath the tank top.
```
```
Floor plates
```
```
No manholes are permitted in the floor plates in the area of the box-shaped
foundation. Welding is to be carried out through the manholes in the outer
girders.
```
```
Top plate supporting
```
```
Provide support in the area of the frames from the nearest girder below.
```
```
Dynamic foundation requirements
```
```
The eigenfrequencies of the foundation and the supporting structures,
including GenSet weight (without engine) shall be higher than 20 Hz. Occa-
sionally, even higher foundation eigenfrequencies are required. For further
information refer to section Noise and vibration – Impact on foundation, Page
148.

## 2.32.3 Chocking with synthetic resin

```
Most classification societies permit the use of the following synthetic resins
for chocking diesel engines:
▪ Chockfast Orange
(Philadelphia Resins Corp. U.S.A)
▪ Epocast 36
(H.A. Springer, Kiel)
MAN Diesel & Turbo accepts engines being chocked with synthetic resin
provided:
▪ If processing is done by authorised agents of the above companies.
▪ If the classification society responsible has approved the synthetic resin
to be used for a unit pressure (engine weight + foundation bolt preload-
ing) of 450 N/cm^2 and a chock temperature of at least 80 °C.
The loaded area of the chocks must be dimensioned in a way, that the pres-
sure effected by the engines dead weight does not exceed 70 N/cm^2
(requirement of some classification societies).
The pretensioning force of the foundation bolts was chosen so that the per-
missible total surface area load of 450 N/cm^2 is not exceeded. This will
ensure that the horizontal thrust resulting from the mass forces is safely
transmitted by the chocks.
The shipyard is responsible for the execution and must also grant the war-
ranty.
Tightening of the foundation bolts only permissible with hydraulic tensioning
device. The point of application of force is the end of the thread with a length
of 85 mm. Nuts definitely must not be tightened with hook spanner and ham-
mer, even for later inspections.

## 2.32.4 Resilient seating

```
General
```
```
The vibration of the engine causes dynamic effects on the foundation. These
effects are attributed to the pulsating reaction forces due to the fluctuating
torque. Additionally, in engines with certain cylinder numbers these effects
are increased by unbalanced forces and couples brought about by rotating
or reciprocating masses which – considering their vector sum – do not
equate to zero.
The direct resilient support makes it possible to reduce the dynamic forces
acting on the foundation, which are generated by every reciprocating engine
and may – under adverse conditions – have harmful effects on the environ-
ment of the engine.
With respect to large engines (bore > 400 mm) MAN Diesel & Turbo offers
two different versions of the resilient mounting (one using conical – the other
inclined sandwich elements).
The inclined resilient mounting was developed especially for ships with high
comfort demands, e.g. passenger ferries and cruise vessels. This mounting
system is characterised by natural frequencies of the resiliently supported
engine being lower than approximately 7 Hz. The resonances are located
away from the excitation frequencies related to operation at nominal speed.
For average demands of comfort, e.g. for merchant ships, and for smaller
engines (bore < 400 mm) mountings using conical mounts can be judged as
being fully sufficient. Because of the stiffer design of the elements the natural
frequencies of the system are significantly higher than in case of the inclined
resilient mounting. The natural frequencies of engines mounted with this kind
of mounts are lower than approximately 18 Hz. The vibration isolation is thus
of lower quality. It is however, still considerably better than a rigid or semi
resilient engine support.
The appropriate design of the resilient support will be selected in accordance
with the demands of the customer, i.e. it will be adjusted to the special
requirements of each plant.
In both versions the supporting elements will be connected directly to the
engine feet by special brackets.
The number, rubber hardness and distribution of the supporting elements
depend on:
▪ The weight of the engine
▪ The centre of gravity of the engine
▪ The desired natural frequencies
Where resilient mounting is applied, the following has to be taken into con-
sideration when designing a propulsion plant:
▪ Resilient mountings always feature several resonances resulting from the
natural mounting frequencies. In spite of the endeavour to keep resonan-
ces as far as possible from nominal speed the lower bound of the speed
range free from resonances will rarely be lower than 70 % of nominal
speed for mountings using inclined mounts and rarely lower than 85 %
for mountings using conical mounts. It must be pointed out that these
percentages are only guide values. The speed interval being free from
resonances may be larger or smaller. These restrictions in speed will
mostly require the deployment of a controllable pitch propeller.

```
▪ Between the resiliently mounted engine and the rigidly mounted gearbox
or alternator, a flexible coupling with minimum axial and radial elastic
forces and large axial and radial displacement capacities should be provi-
ded.
▪ The media connections (compensators) to and from the engine must be
highly flexible whereas the fixations of the compensators on the one
hand with the engine and on the other hand with the environment must
be realised as stiff as possible.
▪ For the inclined resilient support, provision for stopper elements has to
be made because of the sea-state-related movement of the vessel. In
the case of conical mounting, these stoppers are integrated in the ele-
ment.
▪ In order to achieve a good vibration isolation, the lower brackets used to
connect the supporting elements with the ship's foundation are to be fit-
ted at sufficiently rigid points of the foundation. Influences of the founda-
tion's stiffness on the natural frequencies of the resilient support of the
engine will not be considered in the mounting design calculation.
▪ The yard must specify with which inclination related to the plane keel the
engine will be installed in the ship. The inclination must be defined and
communicated before entering the dimensioning process.

## 2.32.6 Engine alignment

```
The alignment of the engine to the attached power train is crucial for trouble-
free operation.
Dependent on the plant installation influencing factors on the alignment might
be:
▪ Thermal expansion of the foundations
▪ Thermal expansion of the engine, alternator or the gearbox
▪ Thermal expansion of the rubber elements in the case of resilient mount-
ing
▪ The settling behaviour of the resilient mounting
▪ Shaft misalignment under pressure
▪ Necessary axial pre-tensioning of the flex-coupling
Therefore take care that a special alignment calculation, resulting in align-
ment tolerance limits will be carried out.
Follow the relevant working instructions of this specific engine type. Align-
ment tolerance limits must not be exceeded.

The monitoring and safety system SaCoSone is responsible for complete
engine operation, control, alarming and safety. All sensors and operating
devices are wired to the engine-attached units. The interface to the plant is
done by means of an Interface Cabinet.
During engine installation, only the bus connections, the power supply and
safety-related signal cables between the Control Unit, Injection Unit, the
Interface Cabinet and the Auxiliary Cabinet are to be laid, as well as connec-
tions to external modules, electrical motors on the engine and parts on site.
The SaCoSone design is based on highly reliable and approved components
as well as modules specially designed for installation on medium speed
engines. The used components are harmonised to an homogenous system.
The system has already been tested and parameterised in the factory.
```
```
SaCoSone Control Unit
```
The Control Unit is attached to the engine cushioned against any vibration. It
includes two identical, highly integrated Control Modules: one for safety func-
tions and the other one for engine control and alarming.
The modules work independently of each other and collect engine measuring
data by means of separate sensors.

From this operating device it is possible to transfer the engine operation
functions to a superior automatic system (propulsion control system, power
management).
In plants with integrated automation systems, this panel can be replaced by
IAS.
The panel can be delivered as loose supply for installation in the control room

## 3.2 Power supply and distribution

```
The plant has to provide electric power for the automation and monitoring
system. In general an uninterrupted 24 V DC power supply is required for
SaCoSone.
An uniterruptible power supply for the speed governor must also be provi-
ded. In case of electronic speed governor with mechanical backup (PGA-EG
or PGG-EG) an uninterruptible 24 V DC power supply is required.
For supply of the electronic fuel actuator (EM80/EM300) an uninterruptible
230 V AC distribution must be provided.

Galvanic isolation

It is important that at least one of the two 24 V DC power supplies per
engine is foreseen as isolated unit with earth fault monitoring to improve the
localisation of possible earth faults. This isolated unit can either be the UPS-
buffered 24 V DC power supply or the 24 V DC power supply without UPS.
Example:
The following overviews shows the exemplary layout for a plant consisting of
four engines. In this example the 24 V DC power supply without UPS is the
isolated unit. The UPS-buffered 24 V DC power supply is used for several
engines. In this case there must be the possibility to disconnect the UPS
from each engine (e.g. via double-pole circuit breaker) for earth fault detec-
tion.

The operation and control can be done from both operating panels. Selec-
tion and activation of the control stations is possible at the Local Operating
Panel. On the displays, all the measuring points acquired by means of
SaCoSone can be shown in clearly arranged drawings and figures. It is not
necessary to install additional speed indicators separately.
The operating rights can be handed over from the Remote Operating Panel
to another Remote Operating Panel or to an external automatic system.
Therefore a handshake is necessary.
For applications with Integrated Automation Systems (IAS) also the function-
ality of the Remote Operating Panel can be taken over by the IAS.

Speed setting
```
```
In case of operating with one of the SaCoSone panels, the engine speed set-
ting is carried out manually by a decrease/increase switch button. If the oper-
ation is controlled by an external system, the speed setting can be done
either by means of binary contacts (e.g. for synchronisation) or by an active
4 – 20 mA analogue signal alternatively. The signal type for this is to be
defined in the project planning period.
```
```
Operating modes
```
```
For alternator applications:
▪ Droop (5-percent speed increase between nominal load and no load)
For propulsion engines:
▪ Isochronous
▪ Master/Slave Operation for operation of two engines on one gear box
The operating mode is pre-selected via the SaCoSone interface and has to be
defined during the application period.
Details regarding special operating modes on request.
```
## 3.4 Functionality

```
Safety functions
```
```
The safety system monitors all operating data of the engine and initiates the
required actions, i.e. load reduction or engine shutdown, in case any limit val-
ues are exceeded. The safety system is separated into Control Module and

```

```
Gateway Module. The Control Module supervises the engine, while the Gate-
way Module examines all functions relevant for the security of the connected
plant components.
The system is designed to ensure that all functions are achieved in accord-
ance with the classification societies' requirements for marine main engines.
The safety system directly influences the emergency shut-down and the
speed control.
In addition to the provisions made to permit the internal initiation of demands,
binary and analogue channels have been provided for the initiation of safety
functions by external systems.
After the exceeding of certain parameters the classification societies demand
a load reduction to 60%. The safety system supervises these parameters
and requests a load reduction, if necessary. The load reduction has to be
carried out by an external system (IAS, PMS, PCS). For safety reasons,
SaCoSone will not reduce the load by itself.
Auto shutdown is an engine shutdown initiated by any automatic supervision
of either engine internal parameters or mentioned above external control sys-
tems. If an engine shutdown is triggered by the safety system, the emer-
gency stop signal has an immediate effect on the emergency shutdown
device, and the speed control. At the same time the emergency stop is trig-
gered, SaCoSone issues a signal resulting in the alternator switch to be
opened.
Emergency stop is an engine shutdown initiated by an operator's manual
action like pressing an emergency stop button.
During operation, safety actions can be suppressed by the override function
for the most parameters. The override has to be activated preventively. The
scope of parameters prepared for override are different and depend to the
chosen classification society. The availability of the override function depends
on the application.
```
```
Alarming
```
```
The alarm function of SaCoSone supervises all necessary parameters and
generates alarms to indicate discrepancies when required. The alarm func-
tions are likewise separated into Control Module and Gateway Module. In the
Gateway Module the supervision of the connected external systems takes
place. The alarm functions are processed in an area completely independent
of the safety system area in the Gateway Module.
```
```
Self-monitoring
```
```
SaCoSone carries out independent self-monitoring functions. Thus, for exam-
ple the connected sensors are checked constantly for function and wire
break. In case of a fault SaCoSone reports the occurred malfunctions in single
system components via system alarms.
```
```
Speed control
```
```
The engine speed control is realised by software functions of the Control
Module/Alarm and the speed governor. Engine speed and crankshaft turn
angle indication is carried out by means of redundant pick ups at the gear
drive.

With electronic speed control, the load distribution is carried out by speed
droop, isochronously by load sharing lines or master/slave operation.
▪ Start fuel limiter
▪ Charge air pressure dependent fuel limiter
▪ Torque limiter
▪ Jump-rate limiter
Note!
In the case of controllable pitch propeller (CPP) units with combinator mode,
the combinator curves must be sent to MAN Diesel & Turbo for assessment
in the design stage. If load control systems of the CPP-supplier are used, the
load control curve is to be sent to MAN Diesel & Turbo in order to check
whether it is below the load limit curve of the engine.
```
```
Shutdown
```
```
The engine shutdown, initiated by safety functions and manual emergency
stops, is carried out by activating the emergency stop and pneumatic fuel
shutoff of the conventional jerk pumps.
Note:
The engine shutdown may have impact on the function of the plant. These
effects can be very diverse depending on the overall design of the plant and
must already be considered in early phase of the project planning.
```
```
Overspeed protection
```
```
The engine speed is monitored in both Control Modules independently. In
case of overspeed each Control Module actuates the shutdown device by a
separate hardware channel.
```
```
Control
```
```
SaCoSone controls all engine-internal functions as well as external compo-
nents, for example:
▪ Requests of lube oil and cooling water pumps.
▪ Monitoring of the prelubrication and post-cooling period.
▪ Monitoring of the acceleration period.

Media Temperature Control
```
```
Various media flows must be controlled to ensure trouble-free engine opera-
tion.
The temperature controllers are available as software functions inside the
Gateway Module of SaCoSone. The temperature controllers are operated by
the displays at the operating panels as far as it is necessary. From the Inter-
face Cabinet the relays actuate the control valves.
▪ The cylinder cooling water (HT) temperature control is equipped with per-
formance-related feed forward control, in order to guarantee the best
control accuracy possible (refer also section Water systems, Page 298).
▪ The low temperature (LT) cooling water temperature control works simi-
larly to the HT cooling water temperature control and can be used if the
LT cooling water system is designed as one individual cooling water sys-
tem per engine.
In case several engines are operated with a combined LT cooling water
system, it is necessary to use an external temperature controller.
This external controller must be mounted on the engine control room
desk and is to be wired to the temperature control valve (refer also sec-
tion Water systems, Page 298).
▪ The charge air temperature control is designed identically with the HT
cooling water temperature control.
The cooling water quantity in the LT part of the charge air cooler is regu-
lated by the charge air temperature control valve (refer also section Water
systems, Page 298).
▪ The design of the lube oil temperature control depends on the engine
type. It is designed either as a thermostatic valve (waxcartridge type) or
as an electric driven control valve with electronic control similar to the HT
temperature controller. Refer also to section Lube oil system description,
Page 279.
```
```
Starters
```
```
For engine attached pumps and motors the starters are installed in the Auxili-
ary Cabinet. Starters for external pumps and consumers are not included in
the SaCoSone scope of supply in general.
```
## 3.5 Interfaces

```
Data Bus Interface (Machinery Alarm System)
```
```
This interface serves for data exchange to ship alarm systems or Integrated
Automation Systems (IAS).
The interface is actuated with MODBUS protocol and is available as:
▪ Ethernet interface (MODBUS over TCP) or as
▪ Serial interface (MODBUS RTU) RS422/RS485, Standard 5 wire with
electrical isolation (cable length ≤ 100 m).
Only if the Ethernet interface is used, the transfer of data can be handled with
timestamps from SaCoSone.
The status messages, alarms and safety actions, which are generated in the
system, can be transferred. All measuring values acquired by SaCoSone are
available for transfer.

## 3.7 Installation requirements

```
Location
```
```
The Interface Cabinet and the Auxiliary Cabinet are designed for installation in
engine rooms or engine control rooms. Both cabinets should be located side
by side.
The cabinets must be installed at a location suitable for service inspection.
Do not install the cabinets close to heat-generating devices.
In case of installation at walls, the distance between the cabinets and the
wall has to be at least 100 mm in order to allow air convection.
Regarding the installation in engine rooms, the cabinets should be supplied
with fresh air by the engine room ventilation through a dedicated ventilation
air pipe near the engine.
Note:
If the restrictions for ambient temperature can not be kept, the cabinet must
be ordered with an optional air condition system.
```
```
Ambient air conditions
```
```
For restrictions of ambient conditions, refer to the section Technical data,
Page 209.
```
```
Cabling
```
```
The interconnection cables between the engine and the Interface Cabinet
and Auxiliary Cabinet have to be installed according to the rules of electro-
magnetic compatibility. Control cables and power cables have to be routed
in separate cable ducts.
The cables for the connection of sensors and actuators which are not moun-
ted on the engine are not included in the scope of MAN Diesel & Turbo sup-
ply. Shielded cables have to be used for the cabling of sensors. For electrical
noise protection, an electric ground connection must be made from the cabi-
nets to the hull of the ship.

```

```
All cabling between the Interface Cabinet and Auxiliary Cabinet and the con-
trolled device is scope of yard supply.
The cabinet are equipped with spring loaded terminal clamps. All wiring to
external systems should be carried out without conductor sleeves.
The redundant CAN cables are MAN Diesel & Turbo scope of supply. If the
customer provides these cables, the cable must have a characteristic impe-
dance of 120 Ω.

Installation works
```
```
During the installation period the yard has to protect the cabinets against
water, dust and fire. It is not permissible to do any welding near the cabinets.
The cabinets have to be fixed to the floor by screws.
If it is inevitable to do welding near the cabinets, the cabinets and panels
have to be protected against heat, electric current and electromagnetic influ-
ences. To guarantee protection against current, all of the cabling must be
disconnected from the affected components.
The installation of additional components inside the cabinets is only permissi-
ble after approval by the responsible project manager of MAN Diesel &
Turbo.
```
```
Installation of sensor 1TE6000 „Ambient air temp”
```
```
The sensor 1TE6000 “Ambient air temp” (double Pt1000) measures the tem-
perature of the (outdoor) ambient air. The temperature of the ambient air will
typically differ from that in the engine room.
The sensor may be installed in the ventilation duct of the fan blowing the
(outdoor) ambient air into the engine room. Ensure to keep the sensor away
from the influence of heat sources or radiation. The image below shows two
options of installing the sensors correctly:

A base number (BN) that is too low is critical due to the risk of corrosion.
A base number that is too high, could lead to deposits/sedimentation.

## 4.1.2 Fuel

```
The engine is designed for operation with HFO, MDO (DMB) and MGO (DMA,
DMZ) according to ISO8217-2010 in the qualities quoted in the relevant sec-
tions.
Additional requirements for HFO before engine:
▪ Water content before engine: Max. 0.2 %
▪ Al + Si content before engine: Max 15 mg/kg
```
```
Engine operation with DM-grade fuel according to ISO 8217-2010, viscosity

Engines that are normally operated with heavy fuel, can also be operated
with DM-grade fuel for short periods.
Boundary conditions:
▪ DM-grade fuel in accordance with stated specifications and a viscosity of
≥ 2 cSt at 40 °C
▪ MGO-operation maximum 72 hours within a two-week period (cumula-
tive with distribution as required)
▪ Fuel oil cooler switched on and fuel oil temperature before engine
≤ 45 °C. In general, the minimum viscosity before engine of 1.9 cSt must
not be undershoot!
For long-term (> 72 h) or continuous operation with DM-grade fuel special
engine- and plant-related planning prerequisites must be set and special
actions are necessary during operation.

system, which can be activated and cut off manually, are necessary
Following features are required on plant side:
▪ Layout of fuel system to be adapted for low-viscosity fuel (capacity and
design of fuel supply and booster pump)
▪ Cooler layout in fuel system for a fuel oil temperature before engine of
≤ 45 °C (min. permissible viscosity before engine 1.9 cSt)
▪ Nozzle cooling system with possibility to be turned off and on during
engine operation

40 °C
▪ Fuel oil cooler activated and fuel oil temperature before engine ≤ 45 °C.
In general the minimum viscosity before engine of 1.9 cSt must not be
undershoot!
▪ Valve seat lubrication turned on
▪ In case of conventional injection system, sealing oil of injection pumps
activated
▪ Nozzle cooling system switched off
Continuous operation with MGO (DMA, DMZ):
▪ Lube oil for diesel operation (BN10-BN16) has to be used
```
```
Operation with heavy fuel oil of a sulphur content of < 1.5 %
```
```
Previous experience with stationary engines using heavy fuel of a low sulphur
content does not show any restriction in the utilisation of these fuels, provi-
ded that the combustion properties are not affected negatively.
This may well change if in the future new methods are developed to produce
low sulphur-containing heavy fuels.
If it is intended to run continuously with low sulphur-containing heavy fuel,
lube oil with a low BN (BN30) has to be used. This is required, in spite of
experiences that engines have been proven to be very robust with regard to
the continuous usage of the standard lube oil (BN40) for this purpose.
```
```
Instruction for minimum admissible fuel temperature
```
```
▪ In general the minimum viscosity before engine of 1.9 cSt must not be
undershoot.
▪ The fuel specific characteristic values “pour point” and “cold filter plug-
ging point” have to be observed to ensure pumpability respectively filter-
ability of the fuel oil.
▪ Fuel temperatures of approximately minus 10 °C and less have to be
avoided, due to temporarily embrittlement of seals used in the engines
fuel oil system and as a result their possibly loss of function.

## 4.2 Specification of lubricating oil (SAE 40) for operation with MGO/MDO and biofuels

```
General
```
```
The specific output achieved by modern diesel engines combined with the
use of fuels that satisfy the quality requirements more and more frequently
increase the demands on the performance of the lubricating oil which must
therefore be carefully selected.
Doped lubricating oils (HD oils) have a proven track record as lubricants for
the drive, cylinder, turbocharger and also for cooling the piston. Doped lubri-
cating oils contain additives that, amongst other things, ensure dirt absorp-
tion capability, cleaning of the engine and the neutralisation of acidic com-
bustion products.
Only lubricating oils that have been approved by MAN Diesel & Turbo may be
used. These are listed in the tables below.
```
```
Specifications
```
```
The base oil (doped lubricating oil = base oil + additives) must have a narrow
distillation range and be refined using modern methods. If it contains paraf-
fins, they must not impair the thermal stability or oxidation stability.
The base oil must comply with the following limit values, particularly in terms
of its resistance to ageing.

```
```
The base oil to which the additives have been added (doped lubricating oil)
must have the following properties:
The additives must be dissolved in the oil, and their composition must ensure
that as little ash as possible remains after combustion.
The ash must be soft. If this prerequisite is not met, it is likely the rate of dep-
osition in the combustion chamber will be higher, particularly at the outlet
valves and at the turbocharger inlet housing. Hard additive ash promotes pit-
ting of the valve seats, and causes valve burn-out, it also increases mechani-
cal wear of the cylinder liners.
Additives must not increase the rate, at which the filter elements in the active
or used condition are blocked.
The washing ability must be high enough to prevent the accumulation of tar
and coke residue as a result of fuel combustion.
The selected dispersibility must be such that commercially-available lubricat-
ing oil cleaning systems can remove harmful contaminants from the oil used,
i.e. the oil must possess good filtering properties and separability.
The neutralisation capability (ASTM D2896) must be high enough to neutral-
ise the acidic products produced during combustion. The reaction time of
the additive must be harmonised with the process in the combustion cham-
ber.
The evaporation tendency must be as low as possible as otherwise the oil
consumption will be adversely affected.
The lubricating oil must not contain viscosity index improver. Fresh oil must
not contain water or other contaminants.

We recommend doped lubricating oils (HD oils) according to international
specifications MIL-L 2104 or API-CD with a base number of BN 10 – 16 mg
KOH/g. Military specification O-278 lubricating oils may be used.
The operating conditions of the engine and the quality of the fuel determine
the additive fractions the lubricating oil should contain. If marine diesel oil is
used, which has a high sulphur content of 1.5 up to 2.0 weight %, a base
number of appr. 20 should be selected. However, the operating results that
ensure the most efficient engine operation ultimately determine the additive
content.
In engines with separate cylinder lubrication systems, the pistons and cylin-
der liners are supplied with lubricating oil via a separate lubricating oil pump.
The quantity of lubricating oil is set at the factory according to the quality of
the fuel to be used and the anticipated operating conditions.
Use a lubricating oil for the cylinder and lubricating circuit as specified above.
Multigrade oil 5W40 should ideally be used in mechanical-hydraulic control-
lers with a separate oil sump, unless the technical documentation for the
speed governor specifies otherwise. If this oil is not available when filling,
15W40 oil may be used instead in exceptional cases. In this case, it makes
no difference whether synthetic or mineral-based oils are used.
The military specification applied for these oils is NATO O-236.
Experience with the drive engine L27/38 has shown that the operating tem-
perature of the Woodward controller UG10MAS and corresponding actuator
for UG723+ can reach temperatures higher than 93 °C. In these cases, we
recommend using synthetic oil such as Castrol Alphasyn HG150. The
engines supplied after March 2005 are already filled with this oil.
The use of other additives with the lubricating oil, or the mixing of different
brands (oils by different manufacturers), is not permitted as this may impair
the performance of the existing additives which have been carefully harmon-
ised with each another, and also specially tailored to the base oil.
Most of the mineral oil companies are in close regular contact with engine
manufacturers, and can therefore provide information on which oil in their
specific product range has been approved by the engine manufacturer for
the particular application. Irrespective of the above, the lubricating oil manu-
facturers are in any case responsible for the quality and characteristics of
their products. If you have any questions, we will be happy to provide you
with further information.
There are no prescribed oil change intervals for MAN Diesel & Turbo medium
speed engines. The oil properties must be regularly analysed. As long as the
oil properties are within the defined limit values the oil may be used further.
See table Limit values for used lubricating oil, Page 231.
An oil sample must be analysed every 1-3 months (see maintenance sched-
ule). The quality of the oil can only be maintained if it is cleaned using suitable
equipment (e.g. a separator or filter).

Due to current and future emission regulations, heavy fuel oil cannot be used
in designated regions. Low-sulphur diesel fuel must be used in these regions
instead.
If the engine is operated with low-sulphur diesel fuel for less than 1,000 h, a
lubricating oil which is suitable for HFO operation (BN 30 – 55 mg KOH/g)
can be used during this period.
If the engine is operated provisionally with low-sulphur diesel fuel for more
than 1,000 h and is subsequently operated once again with HFO, a lubricat-
ing oil with a BN of 20 must be used. If the BN 20 lubricating oil from the
same manufacturer as the lubricating oil is used for HFO operation with
higher BN (40 or 50), an oil change will not be required when effecting the
changeover. It will be sufficient to use BN 20 oil when replenishing the used
lubricating oil.
If you wish to operate the engine with HFO once again, it will be necessary to
change over in good time to lubricating oil with a higher BN (30 – 55). If the
lubricating oil with higher BN is by the same manufacturer as the BN 20 lubri-
cating oil, the changeover can also be effected without an oil change. In
doing so, the lubricating oil with higher BN (30 – 55) must be used to replen-
ish the used lubricating oil roughly 2 weeks prior to resuming HFO operation.
```

Regular analysis of lube oil samples is very important for safe engine opera-
tion. We can analyse fuel for customers at MAN Diesel & Turbo laboratory
PrimeServLab.
Note:
If operating fluids are improperly handled, this can pose a danger to health,
safety and the environment. The relevant safety information by the supplier of
operating fluids must be observed.

```
General
```
```
The specific output achieved by modern diesel engines combined with the
use of fuels that satisfy the quality requirements more and more frequently
increase the demands on the performance of the lubricating oil which must
therefore be carefully selected.
Medium alkalinity lubricating oils have a proven track record as lubricants for
the moving parts and turbocharger cylinder and for cooling the pistons.
Lubricating oils of medium alkalinity contain additives that, in addition to
other properties, ensure a higher neutralization reserve than with fully com-
pounded engine oils (HD oils).
International specifications do not exist for medium alkalinity lubricating oils.
A test operation is therefore necessary for a corresponding long period in
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
Only lubricating oils that have been approved by MAN Diesel & Turbo may be
used. See table Approved lubricating oils for HFO-operated MAN Diesel &
Turbo four-stroke engines, Page 232.

Specifications

The base oil (doped lubricating oil = base oil + additives) must have a narrow
distillation range and be refined using modern methods. If it contains paraf-
fins, they must not impair the thermal stability or oxidation stability.
The base oil must comply with the limit values in the table below, particularly
in terms of its resistance to ageing:

The prepared oil (base oil with additives) must have the following properties:
```
```
The additives must be dissolved in the oil and their composition must ensure
that after combustion as little ash as possible is left over, even if the engine is
provisionally operated with distillate oil.
The ash must be soft. If this prerequisite is not met, it is likely the rate of dep-
osition in the combustion chamber will be higher, particularly at the outlet
valves and at the turbocharger inlet housing. Hard additive ash promotes pit-
ting of the valve seats, and causes valve burn-out, it also increases mechani-
cal wear of the cylinder liners.
Additives must not increase the rate, at which the filter elements in the active
or used condition are blocked.
The washing ability must be high enough to prevent the accumulation of tar
and coke residue as a result of fuel combustion.
The lubricating oil must not absorb the deposits produced by the fuel.
The selected dispersibility must be such that commercially-available lubricat-
ing oil cleaning systems can remove harmful contaminants from the oil used,
i.e. the oil must possess good filtering properties and separability.
The neutralisation capability (ASTM D2896) must be high enough to neutral-
ise the acidic products produced during combustion. The reaction time of
the additive must be harmonised with the process in the combustion cham-
ber.
For tips on selecting the base number, refer to the table entitled Base num-
ber to be used for various operating conditions, Page 230.
The evaporation tendency must be as low as possible as otherwise the oil
consumption will be adversely affected.
The lubricating oil must not contain viscosity index improver. Fresh oil must
not contain water or other contaminants.

consumption).
Table 129: Base number to be used for various operating conditions
```
```
To comply with the emissions regulations, the sulphur content of fuels used
nowadays varies. Fuels with low-sulphur content must be used in environ-
mentally-sensitive areas (e.g. SECA). Fuels with higher sulphur content may
be used outside SECA zones. In this case, the BN number of the lube oil
selected must satisfy the requirements for operation using fuel with high-sul-
phur content. A lube oil with low BN number may only be selected if fuel with
a low sulphur content is used exclusively during operation.
However, the practical results demonstrate that the most efficient engine
operation is the factor ultimately determining the permitted additive content.
In engines with separate cylinder lubrication systems, the pistons and cylin-
der liners are supplied with lubricating oil via a separate lubricating oil pump.
The quantity of lubricating oil is set at the factory according to the quality of
the fuel to be used and the anticipated operating conditions.
Use a lubricating oil for the cylinder and lubricating circuit as specified above.
Multigrade oil 5W40 should ideally be used in mechanical-hydraulic control-
lers with a separate oil sump, unless the technical documentation for the
speed governor specifies otherwise. If this oil is not available when filling,
15W40 oil may be used instead in exceptional cases. In this case, it makes
no difference whether synthetic or mineral-based oils are used.
The military specification applied for these oils is NATO O-236.
Experience with the drive engine L27/38 has shown that the operating tem-
perature of the Woodward controller UG10MAS and corresponding actuator
for UG723+ can reach temperatures higher than 93 °C. In these cases, we
recommend using synthetic oil such as Castrol Alphasyn HG150. The
engines supplied after March 2005 are already filled with this oil.
The use of other additives with the lubricating oil, or the mixing of different
brands (oils by different manufacturers), is not permitted as this may impair
the performance of the existing additives which have been carefully harmon-
ised with each another, and also specially tailored to the base oil.
Most of the mineral oil companies are in close regular contact with engine
manufacturers, and can therefore provide information on which oil in their
specific product range has been approved by the engine manufacturer for
the particular application. Irrespective of the above, the lubricating oil manu-

facturers are in any case responsible for the quality and characteristics of
their products. If you have any questions, we will be happy to provide you
with further information.
There are no prescribed oil change intervals for MAN Diesel & Turbo medium
speed engines. The oil properties must be regularly analysed. As long as the
oil properties are within the defined limit values the oil may be used further.
See table Limit values for used lubricating oil, Page 231.
An oil sample must be analysed every 1-3 months (see maintenance sched-
ule). The quality of the oil can only be maintained if it is cleaned using suitable
equipment (e.g. a separator or filter).
Due to current and future emission regulations, heavy fuel oil cannot be used
in designated regions. Low-sulphur diesel fuel must be used in these regions
instead.
If the engine is operated with low-sulphur diesel fuel for less than 1,000 h, a
lubricating oil which is suitable for HFO operation (BN 30 – 55 mg KOH/g)
can be used during this period.
If the engine is operated provisionally with low-sulphur diesel fuel for more
than 1,000 h and is subsequently operated once again with HFO, a lubricat-
ing oil with a BN of 20 must be used. If the BN 20 lubricating oil from the
same manufacturer as the lubricating oil is used for HFO operation with
higher BN (40 or 50), an oil change will not be required when effecting the
changeover. It will be sufficient to use BN 20 oil when replenishing the used
lubricating oil.
If you wish to operate the engine with HFO once again, it will be necessary to
change over in good time to lubricating oil with a higher BN (30 – 55). If the
lubricating oil with higher BN is by the same manufacturer as the BN 20 lubri-
cating oil, the changeover can also be effected without an oil change. In
doing so, the lubricating oil with higher BN (30 – 55) must be used to replen-
ish the used lubricating oil roughly 2 weeks prior to resuming HFO operation.

To ensure sufficient lubrication, a minimum viscosity must be ensured at the
fuel pump. The maximum temperature required to ensure that a viscosity of
more than 1.9 mm^2 /s is maintained upstream of the fuel pump, depends on
the fuel viscosity. In any case, the fuel temperature upstream of the injection
pump must not exceed 45 °C.
Normally, the lubricating ability of diesel oil is sufficient to operate the fuel
injection pump. Desulphurisation of diesel fuels can reduce their lubricity. If
the sulphur content is extremely low (< 500 ppm or 0.05%), the lubricity may
no longer be sufficient. Before using diesel fuels with low sulphur content,
you should therefore ensure that their lubricity is sufficient. This is the case if
the lubricity as specified in ISO 12156-1 does not exceed 520 μm.
You can ensure that these conditions will be met by using motor vehicle die-
sel fuel in accordance with EN 590 as this characteristic value is an integral
part of the specification.
Note:
If operating fluids are improperly handled, this can pose a danger to health,
safety and the environment. The relevant safety information by the supplier of
operating fluids must be observed.

Additional information
```
```
During transshipment and transfer, MDO is handled in the same manner as
residual oil. This means that it is possible for the oil to be mixed with high-
viscosity fuel or heavy fuel oil – with the remnants of these types of fuels in
the bunker ship, for example – that could significantly impair the properties of
the oil.
Normally, the lubricating ability of diesel oil is sufficient to operate the fuel
injection pump. Desulphurisation of diesel fuels can reduce their lubricity. If
the sulphur content is extremely low (< 500 ppm or 0.05%), the lubricity may
no longer be sufficient. Before using diesel fuels with low sulphur content,
you should therefore ensure that their lubricity is sufficient. This is the case if
the lubricity as specified in ISO 12156-1 does not exceed 520 μm.
You can ensure that these conditions will be met by using motor vehicle die-
sel fuel in accordance with EN 590 as this characteristic value is an integral
part of the specification.
The fuel must be free of lubricating oil (ULO – used lubricating oil, old oil).
Fuel is considered as contaminated with lubricating oil when the following
concentrations occur:
Ca > 30 ppm and Zn > 15 ppm or Ca > 30 ppm and P > 15 ppm.

The pour point specifies the temperature at which the oil no longer flows. The
lowest temperature of the fuel in the system should be roughly 10 °C above
the pour point to ensure that the required pumping characteristics are main-
tained.
A minimum viscosity must be observed to ensure sufficient lubrication in the
fuel injection pumps. The temperature of the fuel must therefore not exceed
45 °C.
Seawater causes the fuel system to corrode and also leads to hot corrosion
of the exhaust valves and turbocharger. Seawater also causes insufficient
atomisation and therefore poor mixture formation accompanied by a high
proportion of combustion residues.
Solid foreign matters increase mechanical wear and formation of ash in the
cylinder space.
We recommend the installation of a separator upstream of the fuel filter. Sep-
aration temperature: 40 – 50°C. Most solid particles (sand, rust and catalyst
particles) and water can be removed, and the cleaning intervals of the filter
elements can be extended considerably.
Note:
If operating fluids are improperly handled, this can pose a danger to health,
safety and the environment. The relevant safety information by the supplier of
operating fluids must be observed.

## 4.6 Specification of heavy fuel oil (HFO)

```
Prerequisites
```
```
MAN Diesel & Turbo four-stroke diesel engines can be operated with any
heavy fuel oil obtained from crude oil that also satisfies the requirements in
Table The fuel specification and corresponding characteristics for heavy fuel
oil, Page 238 providing the engine and fuel processing system have been
designed accordingly. To ensure that the relationship between the fuel, spare
parts and repair / maintenance costs remains favourable at all times, the fol-
lowing points should be observed.
```
```
Heavy fuel oil (HFO)
```
```
The quality of the heavy fuel oil largely depends on the quality of crude oil
and on the refining process used. This is why the properties of heavy fuel oils
with the same viscosity may vary considerably depending on the bunker
positions. Heavy fuel oil is normally a mixture of residual oil and distillates.
The components of the mixture are normally obtained from modern refinery
processes, such as Catcracker or Visbreaker. These processes can
adversely affect the stability of the fuel as well as its ignition and combustion
properties. The processing of the heavy fuel oil and the operating result of
the engine also depend heavily on these factors.

Bunker positions with standardised heavy fuel oil qualities should preferably
be used. If oils need to be purchased from independent dealers, also ensure
that these also comply with the international specifications. The engine oper-
ator is responsible for ensuring that suitable heavy fuel oils are chosen.
Fuels intended for use in an engine must satisfy the specifications to ensure
sufficient quality. The limit values for heavy fuel oils are specified in Table The
fuel specification and corresponding characteristics for heavy fuel oil, Page
```
238. The entries in the last column of this Table provide important back-
ground information and must therefore be observed
Different international specifications exist for heavy fuel oils. The most impor-
tant specifications are ISO 8217-2012 and CIMAC-2003. These two specifi-
cations are more or less equivalent. Figure ISO 8217-2012 Specification for
heavy fuel oil indicates the ISO 8217 specifications. All qualities in these
specifications up to K700 can be used, provided the fuel system has been
designed for these fuels. To use any fuels, which do not comply with these
specifications (e.g. crude oil), consultation with Technical Service of MAN
Diesel & Turbo in Augsburg is required. Heavy fuel oils with a maximum den-
sity of 1,010 kg/m3 may only be used if up-to-date separators are installed.
Even though the fuel properties specified in the table entitled The fuel specifi-
cation and corresponding properties for heavy fuel oil, Page 238 satisfy the
above requirements, they probably do not adequately define the ignition and
combustion properties and the stability of the fuel. This means that the oper-
ating behaviour of the engine can depend on properties that are not defined
in the specification. This particularly applies to the oil property that causes
formation of deposits in the combustion chamber, injection system, gas
ducts and exhaust gas system. A number of fuels have a tendency towards
incompatibility with lubricating oil which leads to deposits being formed in the
fuel delivery pump that can block the pumps. It may therefore be necessary
to exclude specific fuels that could cause problems.
The addition of engine oils (old lubricating oil, ULO –used lubricating oil) and
additives that are not manufactured from mineral oils, (coal-tar oil, for exam-
ple), and residual products of chemical or other processes such as solvents
(polymers or chemical waste) is not permitted. Some of the reasons for this
are as follows: abrasive and corrosive effects, unfavourable combustion
characteristics, poor compatibility with mineral oils and, last but not least,
adverse effects on the environment. The order for the fuel must expressly
state what is not permitted as the fuel specifications that generally apply do
not include this limitation.
If engine oils (old lubricating oil, ULO – used lubricating oil) are added to fuel,
this poses a particular danger as the additives in the lubricating oil act as
emulsifiers that cause dirt, water and catfines to be transported as fine sus-
pension. They therefore prevent the necessary cleaning of the fuel. In our
experience (and this has also been the experience of other manufacturers),
this can severely damage the engine and turbocharger components.
The addition of chemical waste products (solvents, for example) to the fuel is
prohibited for environmental protection reasons according to the resolution
of the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee passed on 1st January
1992.
Leak oil collectors that act as receptacles for leak oil, and also return and
overflow pipes in the lube oil system, must not be connected to the fuel tank.
Leak oil lines should be emptied into sludge tanks.

Additional information
```
```
The purpose of the following information is to show the relationship between
the quality of heavy fuel oil, heavy fuel oil processing, the engine operation
and operating results more clearly.
Economical operation with heavy fuel oil within the limit values specified in
the table entitled The fuel specification and corresponding properties for
heavy fuel oil, Page 238 is possible under normal operating conditions, provi-
ded the system is working properly and regular maintenance is carried out. If
these requirements are not satisfied, shorter maintenance intervals, higher
wear and a greater need for spare parts is to be expected. The required
maintenance intervals and operating results determine which quality of heavy
fuel oil should be used.
It is an established fact that the price advantage decreases as viscosity
increases. It is therefore not always economical to use the fuel with the high-
est viscosity as in many cases the quality of this fuel will not be the best.
Heavy fuel oils with a high viscosity may be of an inferior quality. The maxi-
mum permissible viscosity depends on the preheating system installed and
the capacity (flow rate) of the separator.
The prescribed injection viscosity of 12 – 14 mm^2 /s (for GenSets, L16/24,
L21/31, L23/30H, L27/38, L28/32H: 12 - 18 cSt) and corresponding fuel
temperature upstream of the engine must be observed. This is the only way
to ensure efficient atomisation and mixture formation and therefore low-resi-
due combustion. This also prevents mechanical overloading of the injection
system. For the prescribed injection viscosity and/or the required fuel oil tem-
perature upstream of the engine, refer to the viscosity temperature diagram.
Whether or not problems occur with the engine in operation depends on how
carefully the heavy fuel oil has been processed. Particular care should be
taken to ensure that highly-abrasive inorganic foreign matter (catalyst parti-
cles, rust, sand) are effectively removed. It has been shown in practice that
wear as a result of abrasion in the engine increases considerably if the alumi-
num and silicium content is higher than 15 mg/kg.
Viscosity and density influence the cleaning effect. This must be taken into
account when designing and making adjustments to the cleaning system.
Heavy fuel oil is precleaned in the settling tank. The longer the fuel remains in
the tank and the lower the viscosity of heavy fuel oil is, the more effective the
precleaning process will be (maximum preheating temperature of 75 °C to
prevent the formation of asphalt in heavy fuel oil). A settling tank is sufficient
for heavy fuel oils with a viscosity of less than 380 mm^2 /s at 50 °C. If the
heavy fuel oil has a high concentration of foreign matter, or if fuels in accord-
ance with ISO-F-RM, G/H/K380 or H/K700 are to be used, two settling tanks
will be required one of which must be sized for 24-hour operation. Before the
content is moved to the service tank, water and sludge must be drained from
the settling tank.
A separator is particularly suitable for separating material with a higher spe-
cific density – such as water, foreign matter and sludge. The separators must
be self-cleaning (i.e. the cleaning intervals must be triggered automatically).
Only new generation separators should be used. They are extremely effective
throughout a wide density range with no changeover required, and can sep-
arate water from heavy fuel oils with a density of up to 1.01 g/ml at 15 °C.

Figure 97: Arrangement of heavy fuel oil cleaning equipment and/or separator
The separators must be arranged according to the manufacturers' current
recommendations (Alfa Laval and Westphalia). The density and viscosity of
the heavy fuel oil in particular must be taken into account. If separators by
other manufacturers are used, MAN Diesel & Turbo should be consulted.
If the treatment is in accordance with the MAN Diesel & Turbo specifications
and the correct separators are chosen, it may be assumed that the results
stated in the table entitled Achievable Contents of Foreign Matter and Water,
Page 240 for inorganic foreign matter and water in heavy fuel oil will be ach-
ieved at the engine inlet.
Results obtained during operation in practice show that the wear occurs as a
result of abrasion in the injection system and the engine will remain within
acceptable limits if these values are complied with. In addition, an optimum
lube oil treatment process must be ensured.

It is particularly important to ensure that the water separation process is as

finely distributed emulsion. In this form, water also promotes corrosion and

sation and combustion of the heavy fuel oil. If the water absorbed in the fuel
is seawater, harmful sodium chloride and other salts dissolved in this water
will enter the engine.
Water-containing sludge must be removed from the settling tank before the
separation process starts, and must also be removed from the service tank
at regular intervals. The tank's ventilation system must be designed in such a
way that condensate cannot flow back into the tank.
If the vanadium/sodium ratio is unfavourable, the melting point of the heavy
fuel oil ash may fall in the operating area of the exhaust-gas valve which can
lead to high-temperature corrosion. Most of the water and water-soluble
sodium compounds it contains can be removed by pretreating the heavy fuel
oil in the settling tank and in the separators.
The risk of high-temperature corrosion is low if the sodium content is one
third of the vanadium content or less. It must also be ensured that sodium
does not enter the engine in the form of seawater in the intake air.
If the sodium content is higher than 100 mg/kg, this is likely to result in a
higher quantity of salt deposits in the combustion chamber and exhaust-gas
system. This will impair the function of the engine (including the suction func-
tion of the turbocharger).
Under certain conditions, high-temperature corrosion can be prevented by
using a fuel additive that increases the melting point of heavy fuel oil ash (also
see Additives for heavy fuel oils, Page 244).
Fuel ash consists for the greater part of vanadium oxide and nickel sulphate
(see above section for more information). Heavy fuel oils containing a high
proportion of ash in the form of foreign matter, e.g. sand, corrosion com-
pounds and catalyst particles, accelerate the mechanical wear in the engine.
Catalyst particles produced as a result of the catalytic cracking process may
be present in the heavy fuel oils. In most cases, these catalyst particles are
aluminium silicates causing a high degree of wear in the injection system and
the engine. The aluminium content determined, multiplied by a factor of
between 5 and 8 (depending on the catalytic bond), is roughly the same as
the proportion of catalyst remnants in the heavy fuel oil.
If a homogeniser is used, it must never be installed between the settling tank
and separator as otherwise it will not be possible to ensure satisfactory sepa-
ration of harmful contaminants, particularly seawater.
National and international transportation and storage regulations governing
the use of fuels must be complied with in relation to the flash point. In gen-
eral, a flash point of above 60 °C is prescribed for diesel engine fuels.
The pour point is the temperature at which the fuel is no longer flowable
(pumpable). As the pour point of many low-viscosity heavy fuel oils is higher
than 0 °C, the bunker facility must be preheated, unless fuel in accordance
with RMA or RMB is used. The entire bunker facility must be designed in
such a way that the heavy fuel oil can be preheated to around 10 °C above
the pour point.
If the viscosity of the fuel is higher than 1000 mm^2 /s (cSt), or the temperature
is not at least 10 °C above the pour point, pump problems will occur. For
more information, also refer to Low-temperature behaviour (ASTM D 97),
Page 241.
If the proportion of asphalt is more than two thirds of the coke residue (Con-
radson), combustion may be delayed which in turn may increase the forma-
tion of combustion residues, leading to such as deposits on and in the injec-

tion nozzles, large amounts of smoke, low output, increased fuel consump-
tion and a rapid rise in ignition pressure as well as combustion close to the
cylinder wall (thermal overloading of lubricating oil film). If the ratio of asphalt
to coke residues reaches the limit 0.66, and if the asphalt content exceeds
8%, the risk of deposits forming in the combustion chamber and injection
system is higher. These problems can also occur when using unstable heavy
fuel oils, or if incompatible heavy fuel oils are mixed. This would lead to an
increased deposition of asphalt (see Compatibility, Page 244).
Nowadays, to achieve the prescribed reference viscosity, cracking-process
products are used as the low viscosity ingredients of heavy fuel oils although
the ignition characteristics of these oils may also be poor. The cetane num-
ber of these compounds should be > 35. If the proportion of aromatic hydro-
carbons is high (more than 35 %), this also adversely affects the ignition
quality.
The ignition delay in heavy fuel oils with poor ignition characteristics is longer;
the combustion is also delayed which can lead to thermal overloading of the
oil film at the cylinder liner and also high cylinder pressures. The ignition delay
and accompanying increase in pressure in the cylinder are also influenced by
the end temperature and compression pressure, i.e. by the compression
ratio, the charge-air pressure and charge-air temperature.
The disadvantages of using fuels with poor ignition characteristics can be
limited by preheating the charge air in partial load operation and reducing the
output for a limited period. However, a more effective solution is a high com-
pression ratio and operational adjustment of the injection system to the igni-
tion characteristics of the fuel used, as is the case with MAN Diesel & Turbo
piston engines.
The ignition quality is one of the most important properties of the fuel. This
value does not appear in the international specifications because a standar-
dised testing method has only recently become available and not enough
experience has been gathered at this point in order to determine limit values.
The parameters, such as the calculated carbon aromaticity index (CCAI), are
therefore aids that are derived from quantifiable fuel properties. We have
established that this method is suitable for determining the approximate igni-
tion quality of the heavy fuel oil used.
A testing instrument has been developed based on the constant volume
combustion method (fuel combustion analyser FCA) and is currently being
tested by a series of testing laboratories.
The instrument measures the ignition delay to determine the ignition quality
of fuel and this measurement is converted into an instrument-specific cetane
number (FIA-CN or EC). It has been established that in some cases, heavy
fuel oils with a low FIA cetane number or ECN number can cause operating
problems.
As the liquid components of the heavy fuel oil decisively influence the ignition
quality, flow properties and combustion quality, the bunker operator is
responsible for ensuring that the quality of heavy fuel oil delivered is suitable
for the diesel engine. Also see illustration entitled Nomogram for determining
the CCAI – assigning the CCAI ranges to engine types, Page 243.

The engine should be operated at the coolant temperatures prescribed in the
operating handbook for the relevant load. If the temperature of the compo-
nents that are exposed to acidic combustion products is below the acid dew
point, acid corrosion can no longer be effectively prevented, even if alkaline
lube oil is used.

The BN values specified in section Specification of lubricating oil (SAE 40) for
heavy fuel operation (HFO), Page 228 are sufficient, providing the quality of
lubricating oil and the engine's cooling system satisfy the requirements.
The supplier must guarantee that the heavy fuel oil is homogeneous and
remains stable, even after the standard storage period. If different bunker oils
are mixed, this can lead to separation and the associated sludge formation in
the fuel system during which large quantities of sludge accumulate in the
separator that block filters, prevent atomisation and a large amount of resi-
due as a result of combustion.
This is due to incompatibility or instability of the oils. Therefore heavy fuel oil
as much as possible should be removed in the storage tank before bunker-
ing again to prevent incompatibility.
If heavy fuel oil for the main engine is blended with gas oil (MGO) to obtain
the required quality or viscosity of heavy fuel oil, it is extremely important that
the components are compatible (see Compatibility, Page 244).
MAN Diesel & Turbo SE engines can be operated economically without addi-
tives. It is up to the customer to decide whether or not the use of additives is
beneficial. The supplier of the additive must guarantee that the engine opera-
tion will not be impaired by using the product.
The use of heavy fuel oil additives during the warranty period must be avoi-
ded as a basic principle.
Additives that are currently used for diesel engines, as well as their probable
effects on the engine's operation, are summarised in the table below Addi-
tives for heavy fuel oils – classification/effects, Page 244.

From the point of view of an engine manufacturer, a lower limit for the sul-
phur content of heavy fuel oils does not exist. We have not identified any
problems with the low-sulphur heavy fuel oils currently available on the mar-
ket that can be traced back to their sulphur content. This situation may
change in future if new methods are used for the production of low-sulphur
heavy fuel oil (desulphurisation, new blending components). MAN Diesel &
Turbo will monitor developments and inform its customers if required.
If the engine is not always operated with low-sulphur heavy fuel oil, corre-
sponding lubricating oil for the fuel with the highest sulphur content must be
selected.
Note:
If operating fluids are improperly handled, this can pose a danger to health,
safety and the environment. The relevant safety information by the supplier of
operating fluids must be observed.

To check whether the specification provided and/or the necessary delivery
conditions are complied with, we recommend you retain at least one sample
of every bunker oil (at least for the duration of the engine's warranty period).
To ensure that the samples taken are representative of the bunker oil, a sam-
ple should be taken from the transfer line when starting up, halfway through
the operating period and at the end of the bunker period. "Sample Tec" by
Mar-Tec in Hamburg is a suitable testing instrument which can be used to
take samples on a regular basis during bunkering.
To ensure sufficient cleaning of the fuel via the separator, perform regular
functional check by sampling up- and downstream of the separator.
Analysis of HFO samples is very important for safe engine operation. We can
analyse fuel for customers at MAN Diesel & Turbo laboratory PrimeServLab.

preheating temperature
```
```
* With these figures, the temperature drop between the last preheating
device and the fuel injection pump is not taken into account.
A heavy fuel oil with a viscosity of 180 mm^2 /s at 50 °C can reach a viscosity
of 1,000 mm^2 /s at 24 °C (line e) – this is the maximum permissible viscosity
of fuel that the pump can deliver.
A heavy fuel oil discharge temperature of 152 °C is reached when using a
recent state-of-the-art preheating device with 8 bar saturated steam. At
higher temperatures there is a risk of residues forming in the preheating sys-
tem – this leads to a reduction in heating output and thermal overloading of
the heavy fuel oil. Asphalt is also formed in this case, i.e. quality deterioration.
The heavy fuel oil lines between the outlet of the last preheating system and
the injection valve must be suitably insulated to limit the maximum drop in
temperature to 4 °C. This is the only way to achieve the necessary injection
viscosity of 14 mm^2 /s for heavy fuel oils with a reference viscosity of 700
mm^2 /s at 50 °C (the maximum viscosity as defined in the international specifi-
cations such as ISO CIMAC or British Standard). If heavy fuel oil with a low
reference viscosity is used, the injection viscosity should ideally be 12 mm^2 /s
in order to achieve more effective atomisation to reduce the combustion resi-
due.
The delivery pump must be designed for heavy fuel oil with a viscosity of up
to 1,000 mm^2 /s. The pour point also determines whether the pump is capa-
ble of transporting the heavy fuel oil. The bunker facility must be designed so
as to allow the heavy fuel oil to be heated to roughly 10 °C above the pour
point.
Note:
The viscosity of gas oil or diesel oil (marine diesel oil) upstream of the engine
must be at least 1.9 mm^2 /s. If the viscosity is too low, this may cause seizing
of the pump plunger or nozzle needle valves as a result of insufficient lubrica-
tion.
This can be avoided by monitoring the temperature of the fuel. Although the
maximum permissible temperature depends on the viscosity of the fuel, it
must never exceed the following values:
▪ 45 °C at the most with MGO (DMA) and MDO (DMB)
A fuel cooler must therefore be installed.
If the viscosity of the fuel is < 2 cSt at 40 °C, consult the technical service of
MAN Diesel & Turbo SE in Augsburg.

## 4.8 Specification of engine cooling water

```
Preliminary remarks
```
```
An engine coolant is composed as follows: water for heat removal and cool-
ant additive for corrosion protection.
As is also the case with the fuel and lubricating oil, the engine coolant must
be carefully selected, handled and checked. If this is not the case, corrosion,
erosion and cavitation may occur at the walls of the cooling system in con-
tact with water and deposits may form. Deposits obstruct the transfer of heat
and can cause thermal overloading of the cooled parts. The system must be
treated with an anticorrosive agent before bringing it into operation for the
first time. The concentrations prescribed by the engine manufacturer must
always be observed during subsequent operation. The above especially
applies if a chemical additive is added.
```

ers of anticorrosive agents also supply user-friendly testing equipment.
For information on monitoring cooling water, see section Cooling water
inspecting, Page 258.
```
```
Additional information
```
```
If distilled water (from a fresh water generator, for example) or fully desalina-
ted water (from ion exchange or reverse osmosis) is available, this should
ideally be used as the engine coolant. These waters are free of lime and
salts, which means that deposits that could interfere with the transfer of heat
to the coolant, and therefore also reduce the cooling effect, cannot form.
However, these waters are more corrosive than normal hard water as the
thin film of lime scale that would otherwise provide temporary corrosion pro-

tection does not form on the walls. This is why distilled water must be han-
dled particularly carefully and the concentration of the additive must be regu-
larly checked.
The total hardness of the water is the combined effect of the temporary and
permanent hardness. The proportion of calcium and magnesium salts is of
overriding importance. The temporary hardness is determined by the carbo-
nate content of the calcium and magnesium salts. The permanent hardness
is determined by the amount of remaining calcium and magnesium salts (sul-
phates). The temporary (carbonate) hardness is the critical factor that deter-
mines the extent of limescale deposit in the cooling system.
Water with a total hardness of > 10°dGH must be mixed with distilled water
or softened. Subsequent hardening of extremely soft water is only necessary
to prevent foaming if emulsifiable slushing oils are used.
```
```
Damage to the cooling water system
```
```
Corrosion is an electrochemical process that can widely be avoided by
selecting the correct water quality and by carefully handling the water in the
engine cooling system.
Flow cavitation can occur in areas in which high flow velocities and high tur-
bulence is present. If the steam pressure is reached, steam bubbles form
and subsequently collapse in high pressure zones which causes the destruc-
tion of materials in constricted areas.
Erosion is a mechanical process accompanied by material abrasion and the
destruction of protective films by solids that have been drawn in, particularly
in areas with high flow velocities or strong turbulence.
Stress corrosion cracking is a failure mechanism that occurs as a result of
simultaneous dynamic and corrosive stress. This may lead to cracking and
rapid crack propagation in water-cooled, mechanically-loaded components if
the coolant has not been treated correctly.
```
```
Processing of engine cooling water
```
```
The purpose of treating the engine coolant using anticorrosive agents is to
produce a continuous protective film on the walls of cooling surfaces and
therefore prevent the damage referred to above. In order for an anticorrosive
agent to be 100 % effective, it is extremely important that untreated water
satisfies the requirements in the Section Requirements, Page 251.
Protective films can be formed by treating the coolant with anticorrosive
chemicals or emulsifiable slushing oil.
Emulsifiable slushing oils are used less and less frequently as their use has
been considerably restricted by environmental protection regulations, and
because they are rarely available from suppliers for this and other reasons.
Treatment with an anticorrosive agent should be carried out before the
engine is brought into operation for the first time to prevent irreparable initial
damage.
Note:
The engine must not be brought into operation without treating the cooling
water first.

```
Additives for cooling water
```
```
Only the additives approved by MAN Diesel & Turbo and listed in the tables
under the section entitled Approved Coolant Additives may be used.
A coolant additive may only be permitted for use if tested and approved as
per the latest directives of the ICE Research Association (FVV) "Suitability test
of internal combustion engine cooling fluid additives.” The test report must
be obtainable on request. The relevant tests can be carried out on request in
Germany at the staatliche Materialprüfanstalt (Federal Institute for Materials
Research and Testing), Abteilung Oberflächentechnik (Surface Technology
Division), Grafenstraße 2 in D-64283 Darmstadt.
Once the coolant additive has been tested by the FVV, the engine must be
tested in the second step before the final approval is granted.
Additives may only be used in closed circuits where no significant consump-
tion occurs, apart from leaks or evaporation losses. Observe the applicable
environmental protection regulations when disposing of coolant containing
additives. For more information, consult the additive supplier.
```
```
Chemical additives
```
```
Sodium nitrite and sodium borate based additives etc. have a proven track
record. Galvanised iron pipes or zinc sacrificial anodes must not be used in
cooling systems. This corrosion protection is not required due to the prescri-
bed coolant treatment and electrochemical potential reversal that may occur
due to the coolant temperatures which are usual in engines nowadays. If
necessary, the pipes must be deplated.
```
```
Slushing oil
```
```
This additive is an emulsifiable mineral oil with added slushing ingredients. A
thin film of oil forms on the walls of the cooling system. This prevents corro-
sion without interfering with heat transfer, and also prevents limescale depos-
its on the walls of the cooling system.
The significance of emulsifiable corrosion-slushing oils is fading. Oil-based
emulsions are rarely used nowadays for environmental protection reasons
and also because stability problems are known to occur in emulsions.
```
```
Anti-freeze agents
```
```
If temperatures below the freezing point of water in the engine cannot be
excluded, an antifreeze agent that also prevents corrosion must be added to
the cooling system or corresponding parts. Otherwise, the entire system
must be heated.
Sufficient corrosion protection can be provided by adding the products listed
in the table entitled Antifreeze Agent with Slushing Properties, Page 257
(Military specification: Federal Armed Forces Sy-7025), while observing the
prescribed minimum concentration. This concentration prevents freezing at
temperatures down to -22 °C and provides sufficient corrosion protection.
However, the quantity of antifreeze agent actually required always depends
on the lowest temperatures that are to be expected at the place of use.
Antifreeze agents are generally based on ethylene glycol. A suitable chemical
anticorrosive agent must be added if the concentration of the antifreeze
agent prescribed by the user for a specific application does not provide an

```
appropriate level of corrosion protection, or if the concentration of antifreeze
agent used is lower due to less stringent frost protection requirements and
does not provide an appropriate level of corrosion protection. Considering
that the antifreeze agents listed in the table Antifreeze Agents with Slushing
Properties, Page 257 also contain corrosion inhibitors and their compatibility
with other anticorrosive agents is generally not given, only pure glycol may be
used as antifreeze agent in such cases.
Simultaneous use of anticorrosive agent from the table Chemical additives –
nitrite free, Page 257 together with glycol is not permitted, because monitor-
ing the anticorrosive agent concentration in this mixture is no more possible.
Antifreeze agents may only be mixed with one another with the consent of
the manufacturer, even if these agents have the same composition.
Before an antifreeze agent is used, the cooling system must be thoroughly
cleaned.
If the coolant contains emulsifiable slushing oil, antifreeze agent may not be
added as otherwise the emulsion would break up and oil sludge would form
in the cooling system.
```
```
Biocides
```
```
If you cannot avoid using a biocide because the coolant has been contami-
nated by bacteria, observe the following steps:
▪ You must ensure that the biocide to be used is suitable for the specific
application.
▪ The biocide must be compatible with the sealing materials used in the
coolant system and must not react with these.
▪ The biocide and its decomposition products must not contain corrosion-
promoting components. Biocides whose decomposition products con-
tain chloride or sulphate ions are not permitted.
▪ Biocides that cause foaming of coolant are not permitted.
```
```
Prerequisite for effective use of an anticorrosive agent
```
```
Clean cooling system
```
```
As contamination significantly reduces the effectiveness of the additive, the
tanks, pipes, coolers and other parts outside the engine must be free of rust
and other deposits before the engine is started up for the first time and after
repairs of the pipe system.
The entire system must therefore be cleaned with the engine switched off
using a suitable cleaning agent (see section Cooling water system cleaning,
Page 259).
Loose solid matter in particular must be removed by flushing the system
thoroughly as otherwise erosion may occur in locations where the flow veloc-
ity is high.
The cleaning agents must not corrode the seals and materials of the cooling
system. In most cases, the supplier of the coolant additive will be able to
carry out this work and, if this is not possible, will at least be able to provide
suitable products to do this. If this work is carried out by the engine operator,
he should use the services of a specialist supplier of cleaning agents. The
4 Specification for engine supplies cooling system must be flushed thoroughly after cleaning. Once this has

```
been done, the engine coolant must be immediately treated with anticorro-
sive agent. Once the engine has been brought back into operation, the
cleaned system must be checked for leaks.
```
```
Regular checks of the coolant condition and coolant system
```
```
Treated coolant may become contaminated when the engine is in operation,
which causes the additive to loose some of its effectiveness. It is therefore
advisable to regularly check the cooling system and the coolant condition. To
determine leakages in the lube oil system, it is advisable to carry out regular
checks of water in the expansion tank. Indications of oil content in water are,
e.g. discoloration or a visible oil film on the surface of the water sample.
The additive concentration must be checked at least once a week using the
test kits specified by the manufacturer. The results must be documented.
Note:
The chemical additive concentrations shall not be less than the minimum
concentrations indicated in the table Nitrite-containing chemical additives,
Page 256.
Excessively low concentrations can promote corrosion and must be avoided.
If the concentration is slightly above the recommended concentration this will
not result in damage. Concentrations that are more than twice the recom-
mended concentration should be avoided.
Every 2 to 6 months, a coolant sample must be sent to an independent labo-
ratory or to the engine manufacturer for an integrated analysis.
Emulsifiable anticorrosive agents must generally be replaced after abt. 12
months according to the supplier's instructions. When carrying this out, the
entire cooling system must be flushed and, if necessary, cleaned. Once filled
into the system, fresh water must be treated immediately.
If chemical additives or antifreeze agents are used, coolant should be
replaced after 3 years at the latest.
If there is a high concentration of solids (rust) in the system, the water must
be completely replaced and entire system carefully cleaned.
Deposits in the cooling system may be caused by fluids that enter the cool-
ant or by emulsion break-up, corrosion in the system, and limescale deposits
if the water is very hard. If the concentration of chloride ions has increased,
this generally indicates that seawater has entered the system. The maximum
specified concentration of 50 mg chloride ions per kg must not be exceeded
as otherwise the risk of corrosion is too high. If exhaust gas enters the cool-
ant, this can lead to a sudden drop in the pH value or to an increase in the
sulphate content.
Water losses must be compensated for by filling with untreated water that
meets the quality requirements specified in the section Requirements, Page
```
251. The concentration of anticorrosive agent must subsequently be
checked and adjusted if necessary.
Subsequent checks of the coolant are especially required if the coolant had
to be drained off in order to carry out repairs or maintenance.

Protective measures
```
```
Anticorrosive agents contain chemical compounds that can pose a risk to
health or the environment if incorrectly used. Comply with the directions in
the manufacturer's material safety data sheets.
Avoid prolonged direct contact with the skin. Wash hands thoroughly after
use. If larger quantities spray and/or soak into clothing, remove and wash
clothing before wearing it again.
If chemicals come into contact with your eyes, rinse them immediately with
plenty of water and seek medical advice.
Anticorrosive agents are generally harmful to the water cycle. Observe the
relevant statutory requirements for disposal.

## 4.9 Cooling water inspecting

```
Summary
```
```
Acquire and check typical values of the operating media to prevent or limit
damage.
The freshwater used to fill the cooling water circuits must satisfy the specifi-
cations. The cooling water in the system must be checked regularly in
accordance with the maintenance schedule.
The following work/steps is/are necessary:
Acquisition of typical values for the operating fluid, evaluation of the operating
fluid and checking the concentration of the anticorrosive agent.
```
```
Tools/equipment required
```
```
The following equipment can be used:
▪ The MAN Diesel & Turbo water testing kit, or similar testing kit, with all
necessary instruments and chemicals that determine the water hardness,
pH value and chloride content (obtainable from MAN Diesel & Turbo or
Mar-Tec Marine, Hamburg)
When using chemical additives:
▪ Testing equipment in accordance with the supplier's recommendations.
Testing kits from the supplier also include equipment that can be used to
determine the fresh water quality.

```
```
The concentration should be tested every week, and/or according to the
maintenance schedule, using the testing instruments, reagents and instruc-
tions of the relevant supplier.
Chemical slushing oils can only provide effective protection if the right con-
centration is precisely maintained. This is why the concentrations recommen-
ded by MAN Diesel & Turbo (quality specifications in Specification of engine
cooling water, Page 251) must be complied with in all cases. These recom-
mended concentrations may be other than those specified by the manufac-
turer.
The concentration must be checked in accordance with the manufacturer's
instructions or the test can be outsourced to a suitable laboratory. If in
doubt, consult MAN Diesel & Turbo.
Small quantities of lube oil in coolant can be found by visual check during
regular water sampling from the expansion tank.
Regular analysis of coolant is very important for safe engine operation. We
can analyse fuel for customers at MAN Diesel & Turbo laboratory PrimeServ-
Lab.

## 4.10 Cooling water system cleaning

```
Summary
```
```
Remove contamination/residue from operating fluid systems, ensure/re-
establish operating reliability.
Cooling water systems containing deposits or contamination prevent effec-
tive cooling of parts. Contamination and deposits must be regularly elimina-
ted.
This comprises the following:
Cleaning the system and, if required removal of limescale deposits, flushing
the system.
```
```
Cleaning
```
```
The coolant system must be checked for contamination at regular intervals.
Cleaning is required if the degree of contamination is high. This work should
ideally be carried out by a specialist who can provide the right cleaning
agents for the type of deposits and materials in the cooling circuit. The clean-
ing should only be carried out by the engine operator if this cannot be done
by a specialist.
Oil sludge from lubricating oil that has entered the cooling system or a high
concentration of anticorrosive agents can be removed by flushing the system
with fresh water to which some cleaning agent has been added. Suitable

Lime and rust deposits can form if the water is especially hard or if the con-
centration of the anticorrosive agent is too low. A thin lime scale layer can be
left on the surface as experience has shown that this protects against corro-
sion. However, limescale deposits with a thickness of more than 0.5 mm
obstruct the transfer of heat and cause thermal overloading of the compo-
nents being cooled.
Rust that has been flushed out may have an abrasive effect on other parts of
the system, such as the sealing elements of the water pumps. Together with
the elements that are responsible for water hardness, this forms what is
known as ferrous sludge which tends to gather in areas where the flow
velocity is low.
Products that remove limescale deposits are generally suitable for removing
rust. Suitable cleaning agents are listed alphabetically in the table entitled
Cleaning agents for removing lime scale and rust deposits., Page 260 Prod-
ucts by other manufacturers can be used providing they have similar proper-
ties. The manufacturer's instructions for use must be strictly observed. Prior
to cleaning, check whether the cleaning agent is suitable for the materials to
be cleaned. The products listed in the table entitled Cleaning agents for
removing lime scale and rust deposits, Page 260 are also suitable for stain-
less steel.

Hydrochloric acid diluted in water or aminosulphonic acid may only be used
in exceptional cases if a special cleaning agent that removes limescale
deposits without causing problems is not available. Observe the following
during application:
▪ Stainless steel heat exchangers must never be treated using diluted
hydrochloric acid.

```
▪ Cooling systems containing non-ferrous metals (aluminium, red bronze,
brass, etc.) must be treated with deactivated aminosulphonic acid. This
acid should be added to water in a concentration of 3 - 5 %. The tem-
perature of the solution should be 40 - 50 °C.
▪ Diluted hydrochloric acid may only be used to clean steel pipes. If hydro-
chloric acid is used as the cleaning agent, there is always a danger that
acid will remain in the system, even when the system has been neutral-
ised and flushed. This residual acid promotes pitting. We therefore rec-
ommend you have the cleaning carried out by a specialist.
The carbon dioxide bubbles that form when limescale deposits are dissolved
can prevent the cleaning agent from reaching boiler scale. It is therefore
absolutely necessary to circulate the water with the cleaning agent to flush
away the gas bubbles and allow them to escape. The length of the cleaning
process depends on the thickness and composition of the deposits. Values
are provided for orientation in the table entitled Cleaning agents for removing
lime scale and rust deposits, Page 260.
The cooling system must be flushed several times once it has been cleaned
using cleaning agents. Replace the water during this process. If acids are
used to carry out the cleaning, neutralise the cooling system afterwards with
suitable chemicals then flush. The system can then be refilled with water that
has been prepared accordingly.
Note:
Start the cleaning operation only when the engine has cooled down. Hot
engine components must not come into contact with cold water. Open the
venting pipes before refilling the cooling water system. Blocked venting pipes
prevent air from escaping which can lead to thermal overloading of the
engine.
Note:
The products to be used can endanger health and may be harmful to the
environment. Follow the manufacturer's handling instructions without fail.
The applicable regulations governing the disposal of cleaning agents or acids
must be observed.

### 4.11 Specification of intake air (combustion air)

```
General
```
```
The quality and condition of intake air (combustion air) have a significant
effect on the engine output, wear and emissions of the engine. In this regard,
not only are the atmospheric conditions extremely important, but also con-
tamination by solid and gaseous foreign matter.
Mineral dust in the intake air increases wear. Chemicals and gases promote
corrosion.
This is why effective cleaning of intake air (combustion air) and regular main-
tenance/cleaning of the air filter are required.
When designing the intake air system, the maximum permissible overall pres-
sure drop (filter, silencer, pipe line) of 20 mbar must be taken into considera-
tion.
Exhaust turbochargers for marine engines are equipped with silencers
enclosed by a filter mat as a standard. The quality class (filter class) of the
filter mat corresponds to the G3 quality in accordance with EN 779.

MAN 32/40 IMO Tier III, Project Guide – Marine, EN 261 (451)
```

```
Requirements
```
```
Liquid fuel engines: As minimum, inlet air (combustion air) must be cleaned
by a G3 class filter as per EN779, if the combustion air is drawn in from
inside (e.g. from the machine room/engine room). If the combustion air is
drawn in from outside, in the environment with a risk of higher inlet air con-
tamination (e.g. due to sand storms, due to loading and unloading grain
cargo vessels or in the surroundings of cement plants), additional measures
must be taken. This includes the use of pre-separators, pulse filter systems
and a higher grade of filter efficiency class at least up to M5 according to EN
779.
Gas engines and dual-fuel engines: As minimum, inlet air (combustion air)
must be cleaned by a G3 class filter as per EN779, if the combustion air is
drawn in from inside (e.g. from machine room/engine room). Gas engines or
dual-fuel engines must be equipped with a dry filter. Oil bath filters are not
permitted because they enrich the inlet air with oil mist. This is not permissi-
ble for gas operated engines because this may result in engine knocking. If
the combustion air is drawn in from outside, in the environment with a risk of
higher inlet air contamination (e.g. due to sand storms, due to loading and
unloading grain cargo vessels or in the surroundings of cement plants) addi-
tional measures must be taken. This includes the use of pre-separators,
pulse filter systems and a higher grade of filter efficiency class at least up to
M5 according to EN 779.
In general, the following applies:
The inlet air path from air filter to engine shall be designed and implemented
airtight so that no false air may be drawn in from the outdoor.
The concentration downstream of the air filter and/or upstream of the turbo-
charger inlet must not exceed the following limit values.
```
```
Properties Limit Unit *
Particle size < 5 μm: minimum 90% of the particle number
Particle size < 10 μm: minimum 98% of the particle number

### 5.1 Basic principles for pipe selection

### 5.1.1 Engine pipe connections and dimensions

```
The external piping systems are to be installed and connected to the engine
by the shipyard. Piping systems are to be designed in order to maintain the
pressure losses at a reasonable level. To achieve this with justifiable costs, it
is recommended to maintain the flow rates as indicated below. Nevertheless,
depending on specific conditions of piping systems, it may be necessary in
some cases to adopt even lower flow rates. Generally it is not recommended
to adopt higher flow rates.
```

Table 150: Recommended flow rates
```
### 5.1.2 Specification of materials for piping

```
General
```
```
▪ The properties of the piping shall conform to international standards, e.g.
DIN EN 10208, DIN EN 10216, DIN EN 10217 or DIN EN 10305, DIN EN
13480-3.
▪ For piping, black steel pipe should be used; stainless steel shall be used
where necessary.
▪ Outer surface of pipes needs to be primed and painted according to the
specification – for stationary power plants consider Q10.09028-5013.
▪ The pipes are to be sound, clean and free from all imperfections. The
internal surfaces must be thoroughly cleaned and all scale, grit, dirt and
sand used in casting or bending removed. No sand is to be used as
packing during bending operations. For further instructions regarding
stationary power plants also consider Q10.09028-2104.
▪ In the case of pipes with forged bends care is to be taken that internal
surfaces are smooth and no stray weld metal left after joining.

Galvanised steel pipe must not be used for the piping of the system as all
additives contained in the engine cooling water attack zinc. Moreover, there
is the risk of the formation of local electrolytic element couples where the zinc

### 5.1.3 Installation of flexible pipe connections for resiliently mounted engines

```
Arrangement of hoses on resiliently mounted engine
```
```
Flexible pipe connections become necessary to connect resiliently mounted
engines with external piping systems. They are used to compensate the
dynamic movements of the engine in relation to the external piping system.
For information about the origin of the dynamic engine movements, their
direction and identity in principle see table Excursions of the L engines, Page
268 and table Excursions of the V engines, Page 269.

The conical mounts (RD214B/X) are fitted with internal stoppers (clearances:
Δlat = ±3 mm, Δvert = ±4 mm); these clearances will not be completely utilised
by the above loading cases.
```
```
Figure 100: Coordinate system
Generally flexible pipes (rubber hoses with steel inlet, metal hoses, PTFE-cor-
rugated hose-lines, rubber bellows with steel inlet, steel bellows, steel com-
pensators) are nearly unable to compensate twisting movements. Therefore
the installation direction of flexible pipes must be vertically (in Z-direction) if
ever possible. An installation in horizontal-axial direction (in X-direction) is not
permitted; an installation in horizontal-lateral (Y-direction) is not recommen-
ded.
```
```
Flange and screw connections
```
```
Flexible pipes delivered loosely by MAN Diesel & Turbo are fitted with flange
connections, for sizes with DN32 upwards. Smaller sizes are fitted with
screw connections. Each flexible pipe is delivered complete with counter
flanges or, those smaller than DN32, with weld-on sockets.
```
```
Arrangement of the external piping system
```
```
Shipyard's pipe system must be exactly arranged so that the flanges or
screw connections do fit without lateral or angular offset. Therefore it is rec-
ommended to adjust the final position of the pipe connections after engine
alignment is completed.

Installation of hoses
```
```
In the case of straight-line-vertical installation, a suitable distance between
the hose connections has to be chosen, so that the hose is installed with a
sag. The hose must not be in tension during operation. To satisfy a correct
sag in a straight-line-vertically installed hose, the distance between the hose
connections (hose installed, engine stopped) has to be approximately 5 %
shorter than the same distance of the unconnected hose (without sag).
In case it is unavoidable (this is not recommended) to connect the hose in
lateral-horizontal direction (Y-direction) the hose must be installed preferably
with a 90° arc. The minimum bending radii, specified in our drawings, are to
be observed.
Never twist the hoses during installation. Turnable lapped flanges on the
hoses avoid this.
Where screw connections are used, steady the hexagon on the hose with a
wrench while fitting the nut.
Comply with all installation instructions of the hose manufacturer.
Depending on the required application rubber hoses with steel inlet, metal
hoses or PTFE-corrugated hose lines are used.
```
```
Installation of steel compensators
```
Steel compensators are used for hot media, e.g. exhaust gas. They can
compensate movements in line and transversal to their centre line, but they
are absolutely unable to compensate twisting movements. Compensators
are very stiff against torsion. For this reason all kind of steel compensators
installed on resilient mounted engines are to be installed in vertical direction.
Note:
Exhaust gas compensators are also used to compensate thermal expansion.
Therefore exhaust gas compensators are required for all type of engine
mountings, also for semi-resilient or rigid mounted engines. But in these
cases the compensators are quite shorter, they are designed only to com-
pensate the thermal expansions and vibrations, but not other dynamic

Angular compensator for fuel oil
```
```
The fuel oil compensator, to be used for resilient mounted engines, can be
an angular system composed of three compensators with different charac-
teristics. Please observe the installation instruction indicated on the specific
drawing.
```
```
Supports of pipes
```
```
Flexible pipes must be installed as near as possible to the engine connection.
On the shipside, directly after the flexible pipe, the pipe is to be fixed with a
sturdy pipe anchor of higher than normal quality. This anchor must be capa-
ble to absorb the reaction forces of the flexible pipe, the hydraulic force of
the fluid and the dynamic force.
Example of the axial force of a compensator to be absorbed by the pipe
anchor:
▪ Hydraulic force
= (Cross section area of the compensator) x (Pressure of the fluid inside)
▪ Reaction force
= (Spring rate of the compensator) x (Displacement of the comp.)
▪ Axial force
= (Hydraulic force) + (Reaction force)
Additionally a sufficient margin has to be included to account for pressure
peaks and vibrations.

### 5.1.4 Condensate amount in charge air pipes and air vessels

```
Figure 103: Diagram condensate amount
```
```
The amount of condensate precipitated from the air can be considerablly
high, particularly in the tropics. It depends on the condition of the intake air
(temperature, relative air humidity) in comparison to the charge air after
charge air cooler (pressure, temperature).
It is important, that no condensed water of the intake air/charge air will be led
to the compressor of the turbocharger, as this may cause damages.
In addition the condensed water quantity in the engine needs to be mini-
mised. This is achieved by controlling the charge air temperature.
How to determine the amount of condensate:
First determine the point I of intersection in the left side of the diagram (intake
air), see figure Diagram condensate amount, Page 274 between the corre-
sponding relative air humidity curve and the ambient air temperature.
Secondly determine the point II of intersection in the right side of the diagram
(charge air) between the corresponding charge air pressure curve and the
charge air temperature. Note that charge air pressure as mentioned in sec-
tion Planning data for emission standard, Page 96 is shown in absolute pres-
sure.
At both points of intersection read out the values [g water/kg air] on the verti-
cally axis.

```
The intake air water content I minus the charge air water content II is the
condensate amount A which will precipitate. If the calculations result is nega-
tive no condensate will occur.
For an example see figure Diagram condensate amount, Page 274. Intake air
water content 30 g/kg minus 26 g/kg = 4 g of water/kg of air will precipitate.
To calculate the condensate amount during filling of the starting air vessel
just use the 30 bar curve (see figure Diagram condensate amount, Page 274)
in a similar procedure.

Solution acc. to above diagram:
Water content of air according to point of intersection (I) kg of water/kg of air 0.030
Maximum water content of air according to point of intersection (II) kg of water/kg of air 0.026
The difference between (I) and (II) is the condensed water amount (A)
A = I – II = 0.030 – 0.026 = 0.004 kg of water/kg of air
Total amount of condensate QA:
QA = A x le x P
QA = 0.004 x 6.9 x 9,000 = 248 kg/h

charging system) accordingly.

The difference between (I) and (III) is the condensed water amount (B)
B = I – III
B = 0.030 – 0.002 = 0.028 kg of water/kg of air

### 5.2.2 Lube oil system description

```
The diagrams represent the standard design of external lube oil service sys-
tems, with a combination of engine mounted and detached, freestanding,
lube oil pump(s). According to the required lube oil quality, see table Main
fuel/lube oil type, Page 221.
The internal lubrication of the engine and the turbocharger is provided with a
force-feed lubrication system.
The lubrication of the cylinder liners is designed as a separate system
attached to the engine but served by the inner lubrication system.
In multi-engine plants, for each engine a separate lube oil system is required.
```
```
Requirements before commissioning of engine
```
```
The flushing of the lube oil system in accordance to the MAN Diesel & Turbo
specification (see the relevant working cards) demands before commission-
ing of the engine, that all installations within the system are in proper opera-
tion. Please be aware that special installations for commissioning are
required and the separator must be in operation from the very first phase of
commissioning.
Please contact MAN Diesel & Turbo or licensee for any uncertainties.

```
MAN 32/40 IMO Tier III, Project Guide – Marine, EN 279 (451)
```

```
T-001/Service tank
```
```
The main purpose of the service tank is to separate air and particles from the
lube oil, before pumping the lube oil to the engine. For the design of the serv-
ice tank the class requirements have to be taken in consideration. For design
requirements of MAN Diesel & Turbo see section Lube oil service tank, Page
292.
H-002/Lube oil heater
```
```
To fulfill the starting conditions (see section Starting conditions, Page 50)
preheating of the lube oil in the service tank is necessary. Therefore the pre-
heater of the separator is often used. The preheater must be enlarged in size
if necessary, so that it can heat up the content of the service tank to ≥ 40 °C,
within 4 hours. If engines have to be kept in stand-by mode, the lube oil of
the corresponding engines always has to be in the temperature range of
starting conditions. Means that also the maximum lube oil temperature limit
should not be exceeded during engine start.
```
```
Suction pipes
```
```
Suction pipes must be installed with a steady slope and dimensioned for the
total resistance (incl. pressure drop for suction filter) not exceeding the pump
suction head. A non-return flap must be installed close to the lube oil tank in
order to prevent the lube oil backflow when the engine has been shut off.
```
```
PSV-004 Safety valve
```
```
For engine mounted pumps the non-return flap which is mentioned in the
paragraph Suction pipes, Page 280 above, needs to be by-passed by a relief
valve to protect the pump seals against high pressure caused by counter
rotation (during shut-down).
```
```
FIL-004/Suction strainer
```
```
The suction strainer protects the lube oil pumps against larger dirt particles
that may have accumulated in the tank. It is recommended to use a cone
type strainer with a mesh size of 1.5 mm. Two manometers installed before
and after the strainer indicate when manual cleaning of filter becomes neces-
sary, which should preferably be done in port.
```
```
P-001/P-074/Lube oil pumps
```
```
For ships with more than one main engine additionaly to the service pump a
prelubrication pump for pre- and postlubrication is necessary. For further
information according that pump see section Planning data for emission
standard, Page 96 and paragraph Lube oil, Page 132. A main lube oil pump
as spare is required to be on board according to class society.
For ships with a single main engine drive it is preferable to design the lube oil
system with a combination of an engine driven lube oil pump (P-001) and an
electrically driven stand-by pump (100 % capacity).
Additionally a prelubrication pump is recommended (not mentioned in the
diagram). If nevertheless the stand-by pump is used for pre- and postlubrica-
tion MAN Diesel & Turbo has to be consulted as there are necessary modifi-
5 Engine supply systems cations in the engine automation.
```

280 (451) MAN 32/40 IMO Tier III, Project Guide – Marine, EN


```
Using the stand-by pump (100 %) for continuous prelubrication is not per-
missible.
As long as the installed stand-by pump provides 100 % capacity of the oper-
ating pump, the class requirement to have a spare part operating pump on
board, is fulfilled.
For design data of these lube oil pumps see section Planning data for emis-
sion standard, Page 96 and the following.
In case of unintended engine stop (e.g. blackout) the postlubrication must be
started as soon as possible (latest within 20 min) after the engine has stop-
ped and must persist for 15 min.
This is required to cool down the bearings of turbocharger and hot inner
engine components.
```
```
HE-002/Lube oil cooler
```
```
Heat data, flow rates and tolerances are indicated in section Planning data
for emission standard, Page 96 and the following.
On the lube oil side, the pressure drop shall not exceed 1.1 bar.
The cooler installation must be designed for easy venting and draining.
```
```
TCV-001/Temperature control valve
```
```
The valve regulates the inlet oil temperature of the engine. The control valve
can be executed with wax-type thermostats.
```
```
Set point lube oil inlet temperature Type of temperature control valve1)
65 °C Thermostatic control valve (wax/copper elements) or electrically actuated control
valve (interface to engine control)
1) Full open temperature of wax/copper elements must be equal to set point.
```
```
Control range lube oil inlet temperature : Set point minus 10 K.
Table 155: Temperature control valve
```
```
Lube oil treatment
```
```
The treatment of the circulating lube oil can be divided into two major func-
tions:
▪ Removal of contaminations to keep up the lube oil performance.
▪ Retention of dirt to protect the engine.
The removal of combustion residues, water and other mechanical contami-
nations is the major task of separators/centrifuges (CF-001) installed in by-
pass to the main lube oil service system of the engine. The installation of a
separator per engine is recommended to ensure a continuous separation
during engine operation.
The filters integrated in the system protect the diesel engine in the main cir-
cuit retaining all residues which may cause a harm to the engine.
Depending on the filter design, the collected residues are to be removed
from the filter mesh by automatic back flushing, manual cleaning or changing
the filter cartridge. The retention capacity of the installed filter should be as
high as possible.

When selecting an appropriate filter arrangement, the customer request for
operation and maintenance, as well as the class requirements, have to be
taken in consideration.
```
```
FIL-001/FIL-002 Arrangement principles for lube oil filters
```
```
Depending on engine type, the number of installed main engines in one plant
and on the safety standard demanded by the customer, different arrange-
ment principles for the filters FIL-001/FIL-002 are possible:
```
```
Option 1 Option 2

```
```
60 μm 34 μm 60 μm
```
```
It is always recommended to install one separator in partial flow of each engine. Filter design has to be approved by
MAN Diesel & Turbo.
Table 156: Arrangement principles for lube oil filters
```
```
FIL-001/Automatic filter
```
```
The automatic back washing filter is to be installed as a main filter. The back
washing/flushing of the filter elements has to be arranged in a way that lube
oil flow and pressure will not be affected. The flushing discharge (oil sludge
mixture) is led to the service tank. The oil will be permanently by-pass
cleaned via suction line into a separator. This provides an efficient final
removal of deposits (see section Lube oil service tank, Page 292).
```
```
As state-of-the-art, automatic filter types are recommended to be equipped
with an integrated second filtration stage. This second stage protects the
engine from particles which may pass the first stage filter elements in case of
any malfunction. If the lube oil system is equipped with a two-stage auto-
matic filter, additional duplex filter FIL-002 can be avoided. As far as the
automatic filter is installed without any additional filters downstream before
the engine inlet, the filter has to be installed as close as possible to the
engine (see table Arrangement principles for lube oil filters, Page 282). In that
case the pipe section between filter and engine inlet must be closely inspec-
ted before installation. This pipe section must be divided and flanges have to
be fitted so that all bends and welding seams can be inspected and cleaned
prior to final installation.

282 (451) MAN 32/40 IMO Tier III, Project Guide – Marine, EN


```
Differential pressure gauges have to be installed to protect the filter car-
tridges and to indicate clogging condition of the filter. A high differential pres-
sure has to be indicated as an alarm.
In case filter stage 1 is not working sufficiently, the engine can run in emer-
gency operation for maximum 72 hours with the second filter stage, but has
to be stopped after. This measure ensures that disturbances in backwashing
do not result in a complete failure of filtering and that the main stream filter
can be cleaned without interrupting filtration.
```
```
FIL-002/Duplex filter as indicator filter
```
```
The indicator filter is a duplex filter, which must be cleaned manually. It must
be installed downstream of the automatic filter, as close as possible to the
engine. The pipe section between filter and engine inlet must be closely
inspected before installation. This pipe section must be divided and flanges
have to be fitted so that all bends and welding seams can be inspected and
cleaned prior to final installation. In case of a two-stage automatic filter, the
installation of a duplex filter can be avoided. Customers who want to fulfil a
higher safety level, are free to mount an additional duplex filter close to the
engine.
The duplex filter protects the engine also in case of malfunctions of the auto-
matic filter. The monitoring system of the automatic filter generates an alarm
signal to alert the operating personnel. A maintenance of the automatic filter
becomes necessary. For this purpose the lube oil flow through the automatic
filter has to be stopped. Single-main engine plants may continue to stay in
operation by by-passing the automatic filter. Lube oil can still be filtrated suffi-
ciently in this situation by only using the duplex filter.
In multi-engine-plants, where it is not possible to by-pass the automatic filter
without loss of lube oil filtration, the affected engine has to be stopped in this
situation.
The design of the duplex filter must ensure that no parts of the filter can
become loose and enter the engine.
The drain connections equipped with shut-off fittings in the two chambers of
the duplex filter returns into the leak oil tank (T-006). Draining will remove the
dirt accumulated in the casing and prevents contamination of the clean oil
side of the filter. Please check also table Arrangement principles for lube oil
filters, Page 282.
```
```
Indication and alarm of filters
```
```
The automatic filter FIL-001 and the duplex filter FIL-002 are equipped with
local visual differential pressure indicators and additionally with differential
pressure switches. The switches are used for pre-alarm and main alarm.

This dp switch has to be installed twice if an intermittent flushing fil-

the automatic flushing procedure.
The second switch is adjusted at the identical set point as the first.
Once the second switch is activated, and after a time delay of
approximately 3 min, the dp pre-alarm "filter is polluted" is gener-
ated. The time delay becomes necessary to effect the automatic
flushing procedure before and to evaluate its effect.

```
```
Table 157: Indication and alarm of filters
```
```
CF-001/Separator
```
```
The lube oil is intensively cleaned by separation in the by-pass thus relieving
the filters and allowing an economical design.
The separator should be of the self-cleaning type. The design is to be based
on a lube oil quantity of 1.0 l/kW. This lube oil quantity should be cleaned
within 24 hours at:
▪ HFO-operation 6 – 7 times
▪ MDO-operation 4 – 5 times
The formula for determining the separator flow rate (Q) is:
```
```
Q [l/h] Separator flow rate
P [kW] Total engine output
n HFO = 7
MDO/MGO = 5
Gas (+ MDO/MGO for ignition only) = 5
```
```
With the evaluated flow rate the size of separator has to be selected accord-
ing to the evaluation table of the manufacturer. The separator rating stated
by the manufacturer should be higher than the flow rate (Q) calculated
according to the formula above.
```
```
Separator equipment
```
```
The preheater H-002 must be able to heat the oil to 95 °C and the size is to
be selected accordingly. In addition to a PI-temperature control, which
avoids a thermal overloading of the oil, silting of the preheater must be pre-
vented by high turbulence of the oil in the preheater.
Control accuracy ±1 °C.
Cruise ships operating in arctic waters require larger preheaters. In this case
the size of the preheater must be calculated with a Δt of 60 K.
The freshwater supplied must be treated as specified by the separator sup-
plier.

```
The supply pumps shall be of the free-standing type, i.e. not mounted on the
separator and are to be installed in the immediate vicinity of the lube oil serv-
ice tank.
This arrangement has three advantages:
▪ Suction of lube oil without causing cavitation.
▪ The lube oil separator does not need to be installed in the vicinity of the
service tank but can be mounted in the separator room together with the
fuel oil separators.
▪ Better matching of the capacity to the required separator throughput.
As a reserve for the lube oil separator, the use of the MDO separator is
admissible. For reserve operation the MDO separator must be converted
accordingly. This includes the pipe connection to the lube oil system which
must not be implemented with valves or spectacle flanges. The connection is
to be executed by removable change-over joints that will definitely prevent
MDO from getting into the lube oil circuit. See also rules and regulations of
classification societies.
```
```
PCV-007/Pressure control valve
```
```
By use of the pressure control valve, a constant lube oil pressure before the
engine is adjusted.
The pressure control valve is installed upstream of the lube oil cooler. The
installation position is to be observed. By spilling off exceeding lube oil quan-
tities upstream of the major components these components can be sized
smaller. The return pipe (spilling pipe) from the pressure control valve returns
into the lube oil service tank.
The measurement point of the pressure control pipe is connected directly to
the engine in order to measure the lube oil pressure at the engine. In this way
the pressure losses of filters, pipes and cooler are compensated automati-
cally.
```
```
TR-001/Condensate trap
```
```
The condensate traps required for the vent pipes of the turbocharger, the
engine crankcase and the service tank must be installed as close as possible
to the vent connections. This will prevent condensate water, which has
formed on the cold venting pipes, to enter the engine or service tank.
See section Crankcase vent and tank vent, Page 296.
```
```
T-006/Leakage oil tank
```
```
Leaked fuel and the dirty oil drained from the lube oil filter casings is collected
in this tank. It is to be emptied into the sludge tank. The content must not be
added to the fuel. It is not permitted to add lube oil to the fuel.
Alternatively, separate leakage oil tanks for fuel and lube oil can be installed.
```
```
Withdrawal points for samples
```
```
Points for drawing lube oil samples are to be provided upstream and down-
stream of the filters and the separator, to verify the effectiveness of these
system components.

```

```
Piping system
```
```
It is recommended to use pipes according to the pressure class PN 10.
```
```
P-012 Transfer pump
```
```
The transfer pump supplies fresh oil from the lube oil storage tank to the
operating tank. Starting and stopping of the pump should preferably be done
automatically by float switches fitted in the tank.
```
```
P-075/Cylinder lube oil pump
```
```
The pump fitted to the engine is driven by an electric motor (asynchronous
motor 380 – 420 V/50 Hz or 380 – 460 V/60 Hz three-phase AC with pole
changing). For the cylinder lubrication MAN Diesel & Turbo will supply a con-
trol unit inclusive a pump contactor, with a power consumption of about
0.5 kW for pump, control and heating.
This value must be doubled for V engines, as two control units (one for each
row) are supplied in one cabinet.
```
### 5.2.3 Low speed operation – Lube oil system

```
In case the engine is operated below 60 % of nominal speed, the following
items have to be taken in account:
▪ Lube oil flow has to be maintained above minimum flow rate, given from
section Planning data for emission standard: IMO Tier II – Electric propul-
sion, Page 96 to section Planning data for emission standard: IMO Tier II
```
- Suction dredger/pumps (mechanical drive), Page 121.
▪ Lube oil pressure at the engine inlet has to be kept above the minimum
pressure given from section Planning data for emission standard: IMO
Tier II – Electric propulsion, Page 96 to section Planning data for emis-
sion standard: IMO Tier II – Suction dredger/pumps (mechanical drive),
Page 121.
The attached lube oil pump may fall below the required performance data,
therefore we recommend using an electrical driven support service pump
(P-090). For installation of the pump see figure Lube oil system – Low speed
operation, Page 287. Performance data for the pump are given in section
Service support pumps for lower speed range of FPP applications, Page 95.
To cover operation during blackout, we recommend connecting the pump to
the emergency power grid (switch over from standard net to emergency grid
in case of blackout).
For details contact MAN Diesel & Turbo or licensee.

### 5.2.4 Prelubrication/postlubrication

```
Prelubrication
```
```
The prelubrication oil pump must be switched on at least 5 minutes before
engine start. The prelubrication oil pump serves to assist the engine attached
main lube oil pump, until this can provide a sufficient flow rate.
```
```
For design data of the pre- and postlubrication pump see section Planning
data for emission standard, Page 96 and paragraph Lube oil, Page 132.
During the starting process, the maximal temperature mentioned in section
Starting conditions, Page 50 must not be exceeded at engine inlet. There-
fore, a small LT cooling waterpump can be necessary if the lube oil cooler is
served only by an attached LT pump.
```
```
Postlubrication
```
```
The prelubrication oil pumps are also to be used for postlubrication after the
engine is turned off.
Postlubrication is effected for a period of 15 min.
```
### 5.2.5 Lube oil outlets

```
Lube oil drain
```
```
Two connections for oil drain pipes are located on both ends of the engine oil
sump.
For an engine installed in the horizontal position, two oil drain pipes are
required, one at the coupling end and one at the free end.
```

```
288 (451) MAN 32/40 IMO Tier III, Project Guide – Marine, EN


```
If the engine is installed in an inclined position, three oil drain pipes are
required, two at the lower end and one at the higher end of the engine oil
sump.
The drain pipes must be kept short. The slanted pipe ends must be
immersed in the oil, so as to create a liquid seal between crankcase and
tank.
```
```
Expansion joints
```
```
At the connection of the oil drain pipes to the service tank, expansion joints
are required.
```
```
Shut-off butterfly valves
```
```
If for lack of space, no cofferdam can be provided underneath the service
tank, it is necessary to install shut-off butterfly valves in the drain pipes. If the
ship should touch ground, these butterfly valves can be shut via linkages to
prevent the ingress of seawater through the engine.
Drain pipes, shut-off butterfly valves with linkages, expansion joints, etc. are
not supplied by the engine builder.

### 5.2.6 Lube oil service tank

```
The lube oil service tank is to be arranged over the entire area below the
engine, in order to ensure uniform vertical thermal expansion of the whole
engine foundation.
To provide for adequate degassing, a minimum distance is required between
tank top and the highest operating level. The low oil level should still permit
the lube oil to be drawn in free of air if the ship is pitching severely
▪ 5° longitudinal inclination for ship's lengths ≥ 100 m
▪ 7.5° longitudinal inclination for ship's lengths < 100 m
A well for the suction pipes of the lube oil pumps is the preferred solution.
The minimum quantity of lube oil for the engine is 1.0 litre/kW. This is a theo-
retical factor for permanent lube oil quality control and the decisive factor for
the design of the by-pass cleaning. The lube oil quantity, which is actually
required during operation, depends on the tank geometry and the volume of
the system (piping, system components), and may exceed the theoretical
minimum quantity to be topped up. The low-level alarm in the service tank is
to be adjusted to a height, which ensures that the pumps can draw in oil,
free of air, at the longitudinal inclinations given above.
The position of the oil drain pipes extending from the engine oil sump and the
oil flow in the tank are to be selected so as to ensure that the oil will remain in
the service tank for the longest possible time for degassing.
Draining oil must not be sucked in at once.
The man holes in the floor plates inside the service tank are to be arranged
so as to ensure sufficient flow to the suction pipe of the pump also at low
lube oil service level.
The tank has to be vented at both ends, according to section Crankcase
vent and tank vent, Page 296.

### 5.3.2 Cooling water system description

```
The diagrams showing cooling water systems for main engines comprising
the possibility of heat utilisation in a freshwater generator and equipment for
preheating of the charge air in a two-stage charge air cooler during part load
operation.
Note:
The arrangement of the cooling water system shown here is only one of
many possible solutions. It is recommended to inform MAN Diesel & Turbo in
advance in case other arrangements should be desired. In any case two sea
water coolers have to be installed to ensure continous operation while one
cooler is shut off (e.g. for cleaning).

For special applications, e.g. GenSets or dual-fuel engines, supplements will
explain specific necessities and deviations.
For the design data of the system components shown in the diagram see
section Planning data for emission standard: IMO Tier II, Page 96 and follow-
ing sections.
The cooling water is to be conditioned using a corrosion inhibitor, see sec-
tion Specification of engine cooling water, Page 251.
LT = Low temperature
HT = High temperature
For coolers operated by seawater (not treated water), lube oil or MDO/MGO
on the primary side and treated freshwater on the secondary side, an addi-
tional safety margin of 10 % related to the heat transfer coefficient is to be
considered. If treated water is applied on both sides, MAN Diesel & Turbo
does not insist on this margin.
In case antifreeze is added to the cooling water, the corresponding lower
heat transfer is to be taken into consideration.
The cooler piping arrangement should include venting and draining facilities
for the cooler.
```
```
Open system
```
```
Characterised by "atmospheric pressure" in the expansion tank. Pre-pres-
sure in the system, at the suction side of the cooling water pump is given by
the geodetic height of the expansion tank (standard value 6 – 9 m above
crankshaft of engine).
```
```
Closed system
```
```
In a closed system, the expansion tank is pressurised and has no venting
connection to open atmosphere. This system is recommended in case the
engine will be operated at cooling water temperatures above 100 °C or an
open expansion tank may not be placed at the required geodetic height. Use
air separators to ensure proper venting of the system.
Note:
Insufficient venting of the cooling water system prevents air from escaping
which can lead to thermal overloading of the engine.
The cooling water system needs to be vented at the highest point in the
cooling system. Additional points with venting lines to be installed in the cool-
ing system according to layout and necessity.
In general LT system and HT system are separate systems, therefore, make
sure that the venting lines are always routed only to the associated expan-
sion tank. The venting pipe must be connected to the expansion tank below
the minimum water level, this prevents oxydation of the cooling water caused
by "splashing" from the venting pipe. The expansion tank should be equip-
ped with venting pipe and flange for filling of water and inhibitors.
Additional notes regarding venting pipe routing:
▪ The ventilation pipe should be continuously inclined (min. 5 degrees).
▪ No restrictions, no kinks in the ventilation pipes.
▪ Merging of ventilation pipes only permitted with appropriate cross-sec-
tional enlargement.

At the lowest point of the cooling system a drain has to be provided. Addi-

layout and necessity, e.g. for components in the system that will be removed

```
```
LT cooling water system
```
```
In general the LT cooling water passes through the following components:
▪ Stage 2 of the two-stage charge air cooler (HE-008)
▪ Lube oil cooler (HE-002)
▪ Nozzle cooling water cooler (HE-005)
▪ Fuel oil cooler (HE-007)
▪ Gear lube oil cooler (HE-023) (or e.g. alternator cooling in case of a die-
sel-electric plant)
▪ LT cooling water cooler (HE-024)
▪ Other components such as, e.g., auxiliary engines (GenSets)
LT cooling water pumps can be either of enginedriven or electrically-driven
type.
In case an engine driven LT pump is used and no electric driven pump (LT
main pump) is installed in the LT circuit, an LT circulation pump has to be
installed. We recommend an electric driven pump with a capacity of approxi-
mately 5 m^3 /h at 2 bar pressure head. The pump has to be operated simulta-
neously to the prelubrication pump. In case a 100 % lube oil standby-pump
is installed, the circulation pump has to be increased to the size of a 100 %
LT standby pump to ensure cooling down the lube oil in the cooler during
prelubrication before engine start. For details please contact MAN Diesel &
Turbo.
The system components of the LT cooling water circuit are designed for a
max. LT cooling water temperature of 38 °C with a corresponding seawater
temperature of 32 °C (tropical conditions).
However, the capacity of the LT cooler (HE-024) is determined by the tem-
perature difference between seawater and LT cooling water. Due to this cor-
relation an LT freshwater temperature of 32 °C can be ensured at a seawater
temperature of 25 °C.
To meet the IMO Tier I/IMO Tier II regulations the set point of the temperature
regulator valve (MOV-016) is to be adjusted to 32 °C. However this tempera-
ture will fluctuate and reach at most 38 °C with a seawater temperature of 32
°C (tropical conditions). In case other temperatures are needed in the LT sys-
tem, the engine setting has to be adapted accordingly. Please contact MAN
Diesel & Turbo for further details.
The charge air cooler stage 2 (HE-008) and the lube oil cooler (HE-002) are
installed in series to obtain a low delivery rate of the LT cooling water pump
(P-076).
The delivery rates of the service and standby pump are mainly determined by
the cooling water required for the charge air cooler stage 2 and the other
coolers.
For operating auxiliary engines (GenSets) in port, the installation of an addi-
tional smaller pump is recommendable.

This three-way valve is to be installed as a mixing valve.
It serves two purposes:
1.In engine part load operation the charge air cooler stage 2 (HE-008) is
partially or completely by-passed, so that a higher charge air temperature
is maintained.
```
2. The valve reduces the accumulation of condensed water during engine
    operation under tropical conditions by regulation of the charge air tem-
    perature. Below a certain intake air temperature the charge air tempera-
    ture is kept constant. When the intake temperature rises, the charge air
    temperature will be increased accordingly.
The three-way valve is to be designed for a pressure loss of 0.3 – 0.6 bar
and is to be equipped with an actuator with high positioning speed. The
actuator must permit manual emergency adjustment.
For the description see section Lube oil system description, Page 279. For
heat data, flow rates and tolerances see section Planning data for emission
standard, Page 96 and the following. For the description of the principal
design criteria see paragraph Cooler dimensioning, general, Page 303.

Planning data for emission standard, Page 96 and the following. For the
description of the principal design criteria for coolers see paragraph Cooler

This is a motor-actuated three-way regulating valve with a linear characteris-
tic. It is to be installed as a mixing valve. It maintains the LT cooling water at
set-point temperature (32 °C standard).
The three-way valve is to be designed for a pressure loss of 0.3 – 0.6 bar. It
is to be equipped with an actuator with normal positioning speed (high speed
not required). The actuator must permit manual emergency adjustment.
Note:
For engine operation with reduced NOx emission, according to IMO Tier
I/IMO Tier II requirement, at 100 % engine load and a seawater temperature
of 25 °C (IMO Tier I/IMO Tier II reference temperature), an LT cooling water
temperature of 32 °C before charge air cooler stage 2 (HE-008) is to be
maintained. For other temperatures, the engine setting has to be adapted.
For further details please contact MAN Diesel & Turbo.
In order to protect the engine and system components, several strainers are
to be provided at the places marked in the diagram before taking the engine
into operation for the first time. The mesh size is 1 mm.
The nozzle cooling water system is a separate and closed cooling circuit. It is
cooled down by LT cooling water via the nozzle cooling water cooler
(HE-005).
Heat data, flow rates and tolerances are indicated in section Planning data
for emission standard, Page 96 and the following. The principal design crite-
ria for coolers has been described before in paragraph Cooler dimensioning,
general, Page 303. For plants with two main engines only one nozzle cooling
water cooler (HE-005) is required. As an option a compact nozzle cooling
module (MOD-005) can be delivered, see section Nozzle cooling water mod-
ule, Page 316.

This cooler is required to dissipate the heat of the fuel injection pumps during
MDO/MGO operation. For the description of the principal design criteria for
coolers see paragraph Cooler dimensioning, general, Page 303. For plants
with more than one engine, connected to the same fuel oil system, only one
MDO/MGO cooler is required.
The effective tank capacity should be high enough to keep approximately 2/3
of the tank content of T-002. In case of twin-engine plants with a common
cooling water system, the tank capacity should be by approximately 50 %
higher. The tanks T-075 and T-002 should be arranged side by side to facili-
tate installation. In any case the tank bottom must be installed above the
highest point of the LT system at any ship inclination.
```
```
For the recommended installation height and the diameter of the connecting
pipe, see table Service tanks capacity, Page 134.
```
```
HT cooling water circuit
```
```
The HT cooling water system consists of the following coolers and heat
exchangers:
▪ Charge air cooler stage 1 (HE-010)
▪ Cylinder cooling
▪ HT cooler (HE-003)
▪ Heat utilisation, e.g. freshwater generator (HE-026)
▪ HT cooling water preheater (H-020)
The HT cooling water pumps can be either of engine-driven or electrically-
driven type. The outlet temperature of the cylinder cooling water at the
engine is to be adjusted to 90 °C.
For HT cooling water systems, where more than one main engine is integra-
ted, each engine should be provided with an individual engine driven HT
cooling water pump. Alternatively common electrically-driven HT cooling
water pumps may be used for all engines. However, an individual HT temper-
ature control valve is required for each engine. The total cooler and pump
capacities are to be adapted accordingly.
The shipyard is responsible for the correct cooling water distribution, ensur-
ing that each engine will be supplied with cooling water at the flow rates
required by the individual engines, under all operating conditions. To meet
this requirement, orifices, flow regulation valves, by-pass systems etc. are to
be installed where necessary. Check total pressure loss in HT cirquit. The
delivery height of the attached pump must not be exceeded.
Before starting a cold engine, it is necessary to preheat the waterjacket up to
60 °C.
For the total heating power required for preheating the HT cooling water from
10 °C to 60 °C within 4 hours see table Heating power, Page 306 below.

These values include the radiation heat losses from the outer surface of the
engine. Also a margin of 20 % for heat losses of the cooling system has been
considered.
To prevent a too quick and uneven heating of the engine, the preheating
temperature of the HT-cooling water must remain mandatory below 90 °C at
engine inlet and the circulation amount may not exceed 30 % of the nominal
flow. The maximum heating power has to be calculated accordingly.
A secondary function of the preheater is to provide heat capacity in the HT
cooling water system during engine part load operation. This is required for
marine propulsion plants with a high freshwater requirement, e.g. on passen-
ger vessels, where frequent load changes are common. It is also required for
arrangements with an additional charge air preheating by deviation of HT
cooling water to the charge air cooler stage 2 (HE-008). In this case the heat
output of the preheater is to be increased by approximately 50 %.
Please avoid an installation of the preheater in parallel to the engine driven
HT-pump. In this case, the preheater may not be operated while the engine
is running. Preheaters operated on steam or thermal oil may cause alarms
since a postcooling of the heat exchanger is not possible after engine start
(preheater pump is blocked by counterpressure of the engine driven pump).
An electrically driven pump becomes necessary to circulate the HT cooling
water during preheating. For the required minimum flow rate see table Mini-
mum flow rate during preheating and post-cooling, Page 307 below.

Table 160: Minimum flow rate during preheating and post-cooling
```
```
The preheating of the main engine with cooling water from auxiliary engines
is also possible, provided that the cooling water is treated in the same way.
In that case, the expansion tanks of the two cooling systems have to be
installed at the same level. Furthermore, it must be checked whether the
available heat is sufficient to pre-heat the main engine. This depends on the
number of auxiliary engines in operation and their load. It is recommended to
install a separate preheater for the main engine, as the available heat from
the auxiliary engines may be insufficient during operation in port.
As an option MAN Diesel & Turbo can supply a compact preheating module
(MOD-004). One module for each main engine is recommended. Depending
on the plant layout, also two engines can be heated by one module.
Please contact MAN Diesel & Turbo to check the hydraulic cirquit and elec-
tric connections.
For heat data, flow rates and tolerances of the heat sources see section
Planning data for emission standard, Page 96 and following sections. For the
description of the principal design criteria for coolers see paragraph Cooler
dimensioning, general, Page 303.
The freshwater generator must be switched off automatically when the cool-
ing water temperature at the engine outlet drops below 88 °C continuously.
This will prevent operation of the engine at too low temperatures.

▪ 1 electrically activated three-way mixing valve with linear characteristic
curve (MOV-002).
▪ 1 temperature sensor TE, directly downstream of the three-way mixing
valve in the supply pipe to charge air cooler stage 1 (for EDS visualisation
and control of preheater valve).
This sensor will be delivered by MAN Diesel & Turbo and has to be instal-
led by the shipyard.
▪ 1 temperature sensor TE, directly downstream of the engine outlet.
This sensor is already installed at the engine by MAN Diesel & Turbo.
The temperature controllers are available as software functions inside the
Gateway Module of SaCoSone. The temperature controllers are operated by
the displays at the operating panels as far as it is necessary. From the Inter-
face Cabinet the relays actuate the control valves.
It serves to maintain the cylinder cooling water temperature constantly at 90
°C at the engine outlet – even in case of frequent load changes – and to pro-
tect the engine from excessive thermal load.
For adjusting the outlet water temperature (constantly to 90 °C) to engine
load and speed, the cooling water inlet temperature is controlled. The elec-
tronic water temperature controller recognizes deviations by means of the
sensor at the engine outlet and afterwards corrects the reference value
accordingly.
▪ The electronic temperature controller is installed in the switch cabinet of
the engine room.
For a stable control mode, the following boundary conditions must be
observed when designing the HT freshwater system:
▪ The temperature sensor is to be installed in the supply pipe to stage 1 of
the charge air cooler. To ensure instantaneous measurement of the mix-
ing temperature of the three-way mixing valve, the distance to the valve
should be 5 to 10 times the pipe diameter.
▪ The three-way valve (MOV-002) is to be installed as a mixing valve. It is
to be designed for a pressure loss of 0.3 – 0.6 bar. It is to be equipped
with an actuator of high positioning speed. The actuator must permit
manual emergency adjustment.
▪ The pipes within the system are to be kept as short as possible in order
to reduce the dead times of the system, especially the pipes between the
three-way mixing valve and the inlet of the charge air cooler stage 1
which are critical for the control.
The same system is required for each engine, also for multi-engine installa-
tions with a common HT fresh water system.
In case of a deviating system layout, MAN Diesel & Turbo is to be consulted.
The engine is normally equipped with an attached HT pump (default solu-
tion).
The standby pump has to be of the electrically driven type.
It is required to cool down the engine for a period of 15 minutes after shut-
down. For this purpose the standby pump can be used. In case that neither
an electrically driven HT cooling water pump nor an electrically driven
standby pump is installed (e.g. multi-engine plants with engine driven HT
cooling water pump without electrically driven HT standby pump, if applica-
ble by the classification rules), it is possible to cool down the engine by a
separate small preheating pump, see table Minimum flow rate during pre-
heating and post-cooling, Page 307. If the optional preheating unit

(MOD-004) with integrated circulation pump is installed, it is also possible to
cool down the engine with this small pump. However, the pump used to cool
down the engine, has to be electrically driven and started automatically after
engine shut-down.
None of the cooling water pumps is a self-priming centrifugal pump.
Design flow rates should not be exceeded by more than 15 % to avoid cavi-
tation in the engine and its systems. A throttling orifice is to be fitted for
adjusting the specified operating point.
The expansion tank compensates changes in system volume and losses due
to leakages. It is to be arranged in such a way, that the tank bottom is situ-
ated above the highest point of the system at any ship inclination.
The expansion pipe shall connect the tank with the suction side of the
pump(s), as close as possible. It is to be installed in a steady rise to the
expansion tank, without any air pockets. Minimum required diameter is
DN 32 for L engines and DN 40 for V engines.
For the required volume of the tank, the recommended installation height and
the diameter of the connection pipe, see table Service tanks capacity, Page
134.
Tank equipment:
▪ Sight glass for level monitoring
▪ Low-level alarm switch
▪ Overflow and filling connection
▪ Inlet for corrosion inhibitor
Only for acceptance by Bureau Veritas:
The condensate deposition in the charge air cooler is drained via the con-
densate monitoring tank. A level switch releases an alarm when condensate
is flooding the tank.
```
### 5.3.3 Cooling water collecting and supply system

```

The tank is to be dimensioned and arranged in such a way that the cooling
water content of the circuits of the cylinder, turbocharger and nozzle cooling
systems can be drained into it for maintenance purposes.
This is necessary to meet the requirements with regard to environmental pro-
tection (water has been treated with chemicals) and corrosion inhibition (re-
use of conditioned cooling water).
```

The attached cooling water pumps may fall below the required performance
data, therefore we recommend to use an electrical driven support service
pump (P 089). For installation of the pump follow strictly the P&ID in the fol-
lowing figure Cooling water system – Low speed operation, Page 311. Per-
formance data for the pump are given from section Planning data for emis-
sion standard, Page 96 to section Planning data for emission standard: IMO
Tier II – Suction dredger/pumps (mechanical drive), Page 121. To cover
operation during blackout, we recommend to connect the pump to the
emergency power grid (switch over from standard net to emergency grid in
case of blackout). For details contact MAN Diesel & Turbo or the licensee.
```
```
Multi engine plants
```
```
In case the plant is designed for two or more engines that are operated
totally independent from each other, the HT-service stand-by-pump may be
used for the function of the support service pump. This item has to be
checked with the classification society and MAN Diesel & Turbo technical
staff. In case the engines are not independent from each other (no redun-
dancy), the system has to be equipped with support pumps as described
above (see paragraph Single engine plant, Page 310 above). For details con-
tact MAN Diesel & Turbo or the licensee.

### 5.3.5 Miscellaneous items

```
Piping
```
```
Coolant additives may attack a zinc layer. It is therefore imperative to avoid to
use galvanised steel pipes. Treatment of cooling water as specified by MAN
Diesel & Turbo will safely protect the inner pipe walls against corrosion.
Moreover, there is the risk of the formation of local electrolytic element cou-
ples where the zinc layer has been worn off, and the risk of aeration corro-
sion where the zinc layer is not properly bonded to the substrate.
See the instructions in our Work card 6682 000.16-01E for cleaning of steel
pipes before fitting.
Pipes shall be manufactured and assembled in a way that ensures a proper
draining of all segments. Venting is to be provided at each high point of the
pipe system and drain openings at each low point.
Cooling water pipes are to be designed according to pressure values and
flow rates stated in section Planning data for emission standard, Page 96
and the following sections. The engine cooling water connections have to be
designed according to PN10/PN16.

Turbocharger washing equipment
```
```
The turbocharger of engines operating on heavy fuel oil must be cleaned at
regular intervals. This requires the installation of a freshwater supply line from
the sanitary system to the turbine washing equipment and two dirty-water
drain pipes via a funnel (for visual inspection) to the sludge tank.
The water lance must be removed after every washing process. This is a pre-
cautionary measure, which serves to prevent an inadvertent admission of
water to the turbocharger.
The compressor washing equipment is completely mounted on the turbo-
charger and is supplied with freshwater from a small tank.
For further information see the turbocharger project guide. You can also find
the latest updates on our website http://www.mandieselturbo.com/
0000089/Products/Turbocharger.html
```
### 5.3.6 Cleaning of charge air cooler (built-in condition) by a ultrasonic device

```
The cooler bundle can be cleaned without being removed. Prior to filling with
cleaning solvent, the charge air cooler and its adjacent housings must be iso-
lated from the turbocharger and charge air pipe using blind flanges.
▪ The casing must be filled and drained with a big firehose with shut-off
valve (see P&I). All piping dimensions DN 80.
▪ If the cooler bundle is contaminated with oil, fill the charge air cooler cas-
ing with freshwater and a liquid washing-up additive.
▪ Insert the ultrasonic cleaning device after addition of the cleaning agent in
default dosing portion.
▪ Flush with freshwater (Quantity: approx. 2x to fill in and to drain).
The contaminated water must be cleaned after every sequence and must be
drained into the dirty water collecting tank.
Recommended cleaning medium:
"PrimeServ Clean MAN C 0186"

Note:
When using cleaning agents:
The instructions of the manufacturers must be observed. Particular the data
sheets with safety relevance must be followed. The temperature of these
products has, (due to the fact that some of them are inflammable), to be at
10 °C lower than the respective flash point. The waste disposal instructions
of the manufacturers must be observed. Follow all terms and conditions of
the Classification Societies.

### 5.3.8 Nozzle cooling system and diagram

```
Nozzle cooling system description
```
```
In HFO operation, the nozzles of the fuel injection valves are cooled by fresh-
water circulation, therefore a nozzle cooling water system is required. It is a
separate and closed system re-cooled by the LT cooling water system, but
not directly in contact with the LT cooling water. The nozzle cooling water is
to be treated with corrosion inhibitor according to MAN Diesel & Turbo speci-
fication see section Specification for engine cooling water, Page 251.
Note:
In diesel engines designed to operate prevalently on HFO the injection valves
are to be cooled during operation on HFO. In the case of MGO or MDO
operation exceeding 72 h, the nozzle cooling is to be switched off and the
supply line is to be closed. The return pipe has to remain open.
In diesel engines designed to operate exclusively on MGO or MDO (no HFO
operation possible), nozzle cooling is not required. The nozzle cooling system
is omitted.
For operation on HFO or gas, the nozzle cooling system has to be activated.

The centrifugal (non self-priming) pump discharges the cooling water via
cooler HE-005 and the strainer FIL-021 to the header pipe on the engine and
then to the individual injection valves.
From here, it is pumped through a manifold into the expansion tank from
where it returns to the pump.
One system can be installed for up to three engines.
For the installation height above the crankshaft centreline see section Plan-
ning data for emission standard, Page 96 and the following.
If there is not enough room to install the tank at the prescribed height, an
alternative pressure system of modular design is available, permitting installa-
tion at the engine room floor level next to the engine (see figure Nozzle cool-
ing system, Page 317).
The system is to be closed with an over-/underpressure valve on tank top to
prevent flashing to steam.
The cooler is to be connected in the LT cooling water circuit according to
schematic diagram. Cooling of the nozzle cooling water is effected by the LT
cooling water.
If an antifreeze is added to the cooling water, the resulting lower heat transfer
rate must be taken into consideration. The cooler is to be provided with vent-
ing and draining facilities.
The temperature control valve with thermal-expansion elements regulates the
flow through the cooler to reach the required inlet temperature of the nozzle
cooling water. It has a regulating range from approximately 50 °C (valve
begins to open the pipe from the cooler) to 60 °C (pipe from the cooler com-
pletely open).
To protect the nozzles for the first commissioning of the engine a strainer has
to be provided. The mesh size is 0.25 mm.
The sensor is mounted upstream of the engine and is delivered loose by
MAN Diesel & Turbo. Wiring to the common engine terminal box is present.
```
### 5.3.9 Nozzle cooling water module

Description
```
```
By means of a circulating pump, the nozzle cooling water is pumped from
the service tank through a heat exchanger and to the fuel injection nozzles.
The return pipe is routed back to the service tank, via a sight glass. Through
the sight glass, the nozzle cooling water can be checked for contamination.
The heat exchanger is integrated in the LT cooling water system. By means
of a temperature control valve, the nozzle cooling water temperature
upstream of the nozzles is kept constant. The performance of the service
pump is monitored within the module by means of a flow switch. If required,
the optional standby pump integrated in the module, is started. Throughput
0.8 – 10.0 m³/h nozzle cooling water, suitable for cooling of all number of cyl-
inders of the current engine types and for single or double engine plants.
Required flow rates for the respective engine types and number of cylinders
see section Planning data for emission standard, Page 96 and the following.

### 5.4 Fuel oil system

### 5.4.1 Marine diesel oil (MDO) treatment system

```
A prerequisite for safe and reliable engine operation with a minimum of serv-
icing is a properly designed and well-functioning fuel oil treatment system.
The schematic diagram shows the system components required for fuel
treatment for marine diesel oil (MDO).
```
```
T-015/MDO storage tank
```
```
The minimum effective capacity of the tank should be sufficient for the opera-
tion of the propulsion plant, as well as for the operation of the auxiliary die-
sels for the maximum duration of voyage including the resulting sediments
and water. Regarding the tank design, the requirements of the respective
classification society are to be observed.

The tank heater must be designed so that the MDO in it is at a temperature
of at least 10 °C minimum above the pour point. The supply of the heating
medium must be automatically controlled as a function of the MDO tempera-
ture.
```
```
T-021/Sludge tank
```
```
If disposal by an incinerator plant is not planned, the tank has to be dimen-
sioned so that it is capable to absorb all residues which accumulate during
the operation in the course of a maximum duration of voyage. In order to
render emptying of the tank possible, it has to be heated.
The heating is to be dimensioned so that the content of the tank can be
heated to approximately 40 °C.
```
```
P-073/MDO supply pump
```
```
The supply pumps should always be electrically driven, i.e. not mounted on

throughput.
```
```
H-019/MDO preheater
```
```
In order to achieve the separating temperature, a separator adapted to suit
the fuel viscosity should be fitted.
```
```
CF-003/MDO separator
```
```
A self-cleaning separator must be provided. The separator is dimensioned in
accordance with the separator manufacturers' guidelines.
The required flow rate (Q) can be roughly determined by the following equa-
tion:
```
```
Q [l/h] Separator flow rate
P [kW] Total engine output
be [g/kWh] Fuel consumption
ρ [g/l] Density at separating temp approximately 870 kg/m^3 =
g/dm^3
```
```
With the evaluated flow rate, the size of the separator has to be selected
according to the evaluation table of the manufacturer. The separator rating
stated by the manufacturer should be higher than the flow rate (Q) calculated
according to the above formula.
By means of the separator flow rate, which was determined in this way, the
separator type, depending on the fuel viscosity, is selected from the lists of
the separator manufacturers.
For the first estimation of the maximum fuel consumption (be), increase the
specific table value by 15 %, see section Planning data, Page 96.
For specific values contact MAN Diesel & Turbo.
In the following, characteristics affecting the fuel oil consumption are listed
exemplary:

### 5.4.2 Marine diesel oil (MDO) supply system for diesel engines

```
General
```
```
The MDO supply system is an open system with open deaeration service
tank. Normally one or two main engines are connected to one fuel system if
required auxiliary engines can be connected to the same fuel system as well
(not indicated in the diagram).
```
```
MDO fuel viscosity
```
```
MDO-DMB with a max. nominal viscosity of 11 cSt (at 40 °C), or lighter MDO
qualities, can be used.
At engine inlet the fuel viscosity should be 11 cSt or less. The fuel tempera-
ture has to be adapted accordingly. It is also to make sure, that the MDO fuel
temperature of max. 45 °C in engine inlet (for all MDO qualities) is not excee-
ded. Therefore, a tank heating and a cooler in the fuel return pipe are
required.
```
```
T-003/MDO service tank
```
```
The classification societies specify that at least two service tanks are to be
installed on board. The minimum tank capacity of each tank should, in addi-
tion to the MDO consumption of other consumers, enable a full load opera-
tion of min. 8 operating hours for all engines under all conditions.
The tank should be provided with a sludge space with a tank bottom inclina-
tion of preferably 10° and sludge drain valves at the lowest point, an overflow
pipe from the MDO/MGO service tank T-003 to the MDO/MGO storage tank
T-015, with heating coils and insulation.
If DMB fuel with 11 cSt (at 40 °C) is used, the tank heating is to be designed
to keep the tank temperature at min. 40 °C.
For lighter types of MDO it is recommended to heat the tank in order to
reach a fuel viscosity of 11 cSt or less. Rules and regulations for tanks,
issued by the classification societies, must be observed.
The required minimum MDO capacity of each service tank is:
```
```
VMDOST = (Qp x to x Ms )/(3 x 1000 l/m^3 )
```
```
Required min. volume of one MDO service tank VMDOST m^3

326 (451) MAN 32/40 IMO Tier III, Project Guide – Marine, EN


```
In case more than one engine or different engines are connected to the same
fuel system, the service tank capacity has to be increased accordingly.
```
```
STR-010/Y-type strainer
```
```
To protect the fuel supply pumps, an approximately 0.5 mm gauge (sphere-
passing mesh) strainer is to be installed at the suction side of each supply
pump.
```
```
P-008/Supply pump
```
```
The supply pump shall keep sufficient fuel pressure before the engine.
The volumetric capacity must be at least 300 % of the maximum fuel con-
sumption of the engine, including margins for:
▪ Tropical conditions
▪ Realistic heating value and
▪ Tolerance
To reach this, the supply pump has to be designed according to the follow-
ing formula:
```
```
Qp = P 1 x brISO1 x f 3
```
```
Required supply pump capacity with MDO 45 °C Qp l/h

```
```

```
```
Factor for pump dimensioning: f 3 = 3.75 x 10-3 f 3 l/g
Table 163: Formula to design the supply pump
```
```
In case more than one engine or different engines are connected to the same
fuel system, the pump capacity has to be increased accordingly.
The delivery height shall be selected with reference to the system losses and
the pressure required before the engine (see section Planning data for emis-
sion standard, Page 96 and the following). Normally the required delivery
height is 10 bar.
```
```
FIL-003/Automatic filter
```
```
The automatic filter should be a type that causes no pressure drop in the
system during flushing sequence. The filter mesh size shall be 0.010 mm
(absolute) for common rail injection and 0.034 mm (absolute) for conventional
injection.
The automatic filter must be equipped with differential pressure indication
and switches.
The design criterion relies on the filter surface load, specified by the filter
manufacturer.
A by-pass pipe in parallel to the automatic filter is required. A stand-by filter
in the by-pass is not required. In case of maintenance on the automatic filter,
the by-pass is to be opened; the fuel is then filtered by the duplex filter
FIL-013.

```
```
FBV-010/Flow balancing valve
```
```
The flow balancing valve FBV-010 is not required.
```
```
The flow balancing valve (1,2FBV-010) is required at the fuel outlet of each
engine. It is used to adjust the individual fuel flow for each engine. It will com-
pensate the influence (flow distribution due to pressure losses) of the piping
system. Once these valves are adjusted, they have to be blocked and must
not be manipulated later.
```
```
PCV-011/Spill valve
```
```
Spill valve PCV-011 is not required.
```
```
In case two engines are operated with one fuel module, it has to be possible
to separate one engine at a time from the fuel circuit for maintenance purpo-
ses. In order to avoid a pressure increase in the pressurised system, the fuel,
which cannot circulate through the shut-off engine, has to be rerouted via
this valve into the return pipe.
This valve is to be adjusted so that rerouting is effected only when the pres-
sure, in comparison to normal operation (multi-engine operation), is excee-
ded. This valve should be designed as a pressure relief valve, not as a safety
valve.
```
```
V-002/Shut-off cock
```
```
Shut-off cock V-002 is not required.
```
```
The stop cock is closed during normal operation (multi-engine operation).
When one engine is separated from the fuel circuit for maintenance purpo-
ses, this cock has to be opened manually.
```
```
HE-007/MDO cooler
```
```
The MDO cooler is required to cool down the fuel, which was heated up
while circulating through the injection pumps. The MDO cooler is normally
connected to the LT cooling water system and should be dimensioned so
that the MDO does not exceed a temperature of max. 45 °C.
The thermal design of the cooler is based on the following data:
```
```
Pc = P 1 x brISO1 x f 1
```
```
Qc = P 1 x brISO1 x f 2

Note:
In case more than one engine, or different engines are connected to the same fuel system, the cooler capacity has to
be increased accordingly.
1) This temperature has to be normally max. 45 °C. Only for very light MGO fuel types this temperature has to be even
lower in order to preserve the min. admissible fuel viscosity in engine inlet (see section Viscosity-temperature diagram
(VT diagram), Page 249).
2) The max. MDO/MGO throughput is identical to the delivery quantity of the installed supply pump P-008.

PCV-008/Pressure retaining valve
```
```
In open fuel supply systems (fuel loop with circulation through the service
tank; service tank under atmospheric pressure) this pressure-retaining valve
is required to keep the system pressure to a certain value against the service
tank. It is to be adjusted so that the pressure before engine inlet can be
maintained in the required range (see section Operating/service temperatures
and pressures, Page 130).
```
```
FSH-001/Leakage fuel monitoring tank
```
```
High pressure pump overflow and escaping fuel from burst control pipes is
carried to the monitoring tanks from which it is drained into the leakage oil
collecting tank. The float switch mounted in the tanks must be connected to
the alarm system. The classification societies require the installation of moni-
toring tanks for unmanned engine rooms. Lloyd's Register specify monitoring
tanks for manned engine rooms as well.
```
```
T-006/Leakage oil collecting tank
```
Leakage fuel from the injection pipes, leakage lubrication oil and dirt fuel oil
from the filters (to be discharged by gravity) are collected in the leakage oil
collecting tank (T-006). The content of this tank has to be discharged into the
sludge tank (T-021) or it can be burned for instance in a waste oil boiler. It is
not permissible to add the content of the tank to the fuel treatment system
again because of contamination with lubrication oil.

```
```
General notes
```
```
The arrangement of the final fuel filter directly upstream of the engine inlet
(depending on the plant design the final filter could be either the duplex filter
FIL-013 or the automatic filter FIL-003) has to ensure that no parts of the fil-
ter itself can be loosen.
The pipe between the final filter and the engine inlet has to be done as short
as possible and is to be cleaned and treated with particular care to prevent
damages (loosen objects/parts) to the engine. Valves or components shall
not be installed in this pipe. It is required to dismantle this pipe completely in
presents of our commissioning personnel for a complete visual inspection of
all internal parts before the first engine start. Therefore, flange pairs have to
be provided on eventually installed bands.
For the fuel piping system we recommend to maintain a MDO flow velocity
between 0.5 and 1.0 m/s in suction pipes and between 1.5 and 2 m/s in
pressure pipes. The recommended pressure class for the fuel pipes is PN16.

### 5.4.3 Heavy fuel oil (HFO) treatment system

```
A prerequisite for safe and reliable engine operation with a minimum of serv-
icing is a properly designed and well-functioning fuel oil treatment system.
The schematic diagram shows the system components required for fuel
treatment for heavy fuel oil (HFO).
```
```
Bunker
```
```
Fuel compatibility problems are avoidable if mixing of newly bunkered fuel
with remaining fuel can be prevented by a suitable number of bunkers. Heat-
ing coils in bunkers need to be designed so that the HFO in it is at a temper-
ature of at least 10 °C minimum above the pour point.
```
```
P-038/Transfer pump
```
```
The transfer pump discharges fuel from the bunkers into the settling tanks.
Being a screw pump, it handles the fuel gently, thus prevent water being
emulsified in the fuel. Its capacity must be sized so that the complete settling
tank can be filled in ≤ 2 hours.
```
```
T-016/Settling tank for HFO
```
```
Two settling tanks should be installed, in order to obtain thorough pre-clean-
ing and to allow fuels of different origin to be kept separate. When using RM-
fuels we recommend two settling tanks for each fuel type (high sulphur HFO,
low sulphur HFO).
Pre-cleaning by settling is the more effective the longer the solid material is
given time to settle. The storage capacity of the settling tank should be
designed to hold at least a 24-hour supply of fuel at full load operation,
including sediments and water the fuel contains.
The minimum volume (V) to be provided is:
```
```
Size
```

```
V [m^3 ] Minimum volume
P [kW] Engine rating
```
```
The heating surfaces should be so dimensioned that the tank content can be
evenly heated to 75 °C within 6 to 8 hours. The supply of heat should be
automatically controlled, depending on the fuel oil temperature.
In order to avoid:
▪ Agitation of the sludge due to heating, the heating coils should be
arranged at a sufficient distance from the tank bottom.
▪ The formation of asphaltene, the fuel oil temperature should not be per-
missible to exceed 75 °C.
▪ The formation of carbon deposits on the heating surfaces, the heat
transferred per unit surface must not exceed 1.1 W/cm^2.
The tank is to be fitted with baffle plates in longitudinal and transverse direc-
tion in order to reduce agitation of the fuel in the tank in rough seas as far as
possible. The suction pipe of the separator must not reach into the sludge
space. One or more sludge drain valves, depending on the slant of the tank
bottom (preferably 10°), are to be provided at the lowest point. Tanks reach-
ing to the ship hull must be heat loss protected by a cofferdam. The settling
tank is to be insulated against thermal losses.
Sludge must be removed from the settling tank before the separators draw
fuel from it.
```
```
T-021/Sludge tank
```
```
If disposal by an incinerator plant is not planned, the tank has to be dimen-
sioned so that it is capable to absorb all residues which accumulate during
the operation in the course of a maximum duration of voyage. In order to
render emptying of the tank possible, it has to be heated.
The heating is to be dimensioned so that the content of the tank can be
heated to approximately 60 °C.
```
```
P-015/Heavy fuel supply pump
```
```
The supply pumps should preferably be of the free-standing type, i.e. not
mounted on the separator, as the delivery volume can be matched better to
the required throughput.
```
```
H-008/Preheater for HFO
```
```
To reach the separating temperature a preheater matched to the fuel viscos-
ity has to be installed.
```
```
CF-002/Separator
```
```
As a rule, poor quality, high viscosity fuel is used. Two new generation sepa-
rators must therefore be installed.

Westfalia: Unitrol, type OSE
Separators must always be provided in sets of 2 of the same type
▪ 1 service separator
▪ 1 stand-by separator
of self-cleaning type.
As a matter of principle, all separators are to be equipped with an automatic
programme control for continuous desludging and monitoring.
The stand-by separator is always to be put into service, to achieve the best
possible fuel cleaning effect with the separator plant as installed.
The piping of both separators is to be arranged in accordance with the man-
ufacturer ́s advice, preferably for both parallel and series operation.
The discharge flow of the free-standing dirty oil pump is to be split up equally
between the two separators in parallel operation.
The freshwater supplied must be treated as specified by the separator sup-
plier.
The required flow rate (Q) can be roughly determined by the following equa-
tion:
The required design flow rate (Q) can be roughly determined by the following
equation:
```
```
Q [l/h] Separator flow rate
P [kW] Total engine output
be [g/kWh] Fuel consumption
ρ [g/l] Density at separating temp approximately 930 kg/m^3 =
g/dm^3
```
```
With the evaluated flow rate, the size of the separator has to be selected
according to the evaluation table of the manufacturer. The separator rating
stated by the manufacturer should be higher than the flow rate (Q) calculated
according to the above formula.
By means of the separator flow rate, which was determined in this way, the
separator type, depending on the fuel viscosity, is selected from the lists of
the separator manufacturers.
For the first estimation of the maximum fuel consumption (be), increase the
specific table value by 15 %, see section Planning data, Page 96.
For specific values contact MAN Diesel & Turbo.
In the following, characteristics affecting the fuel oil consumption are listed
exemplary:
▪ Tropical conditions
▪ The engine-mounted pumps
▪ Fluctuations of the calorific value
▪ The consumption tolerance

### 5.4.4 Heavy fuel oil (HFO) supply system

```
To ensure that high-viscosity fuel oils achieve the specified injection viscosity,
a preheating temperature is necessary, which may cause degassing prob-
lems in conventional, pressureless systems.
A remedial measure is adopting a pressurised system in which the required
system pressure is 1 bar above the evaporation pressure of water.

```
The indicated pressures are minimum requirements due to the fuel charac-
teristic. Nevertheless, to meet the required fuel pressure at the engine inlet
(see section Planning data for emission standard, Page 96 and the following),
the pressure in the mixing tank and booster circuit becomes significant
higher as indicated in this table.
```
```
T-022/Heavy fuel oil service tank
```
```
The heavy fuel oil cleaned in the separator is passed to the service tank, and
as the separators are in continuous operation, the tank is always kept filled.
To fulfil this requirement it is necessary to fit the heavy fuel oil service tank
T-022 with overflow pipes, which are connected with the setting tanks
T-016. The tank capacity is to be designed for at least eight-hours' fuel sup-
ply at full load so as to provide for a sufficient period of time for separator
maintenance.
The tank should have a sludge space with a tank bottom inclination of pref-
erably 10°, with sludge drain valves at the lowest point, and is to be equip-
ped with heating coils.
The sludge must be drained from the service tank at regular intervals.
The heating coils are to be designed for a tank temperature of 75 °C.
The rules and regulations for tanks issued by the classification societies must
be observed.

T-003/MDO/MGO service tank
```
```
The classification societies specify that at least two service tanks are to be
installed on board. The minimum volume of each tank should, in addition to
the MDO/MGO consumption of the generating sets, enable an eight-hour full
load operation of the main engine.
Cleaning of the MDO/MGO by an additional separator should, in the first
place, be designed to meet the requirements of the diesel alternator sets on
board. The tank should be provided, like the heavy fuel oil service tank, with
a sludge space with sludge drain valve and with an overflow pipe from the
MDO/MGO service tank T-003 to the MDO/MGO storage tank T-015. For
more detailed information see section Marine diesel oil (MDO) supply system,

the viscosity measuring and control system during MDO/MGO operation.
```
```
STR-010/Y-type strainer

system. Once these valves are adjusted, they have to be blocked and must
not be manipulated later.

High pressure pump overflow and escaping fuel from burst control pipes is
carried to the monitoring tanks from which it is drained into the leakage oil
collecting tank. The float switch mounted in the tanks must be connected to
the alarm system. All parts of the monitored leakage system (pipes and mon-
itoring tank) have to be designed for a fuel rate of 6.7 l/cyl. x min). The classi-
fication societies require the installation of monitoring tanks for unmanned

HE-007/CK-003 MDO/MGO cooler/three way cock
```
```
The propose of the MDO/MGO cooler is to ensure that the viscosity of
MDO/MGO will not become too fluid in engine inlet.
With CK-003, the MDO/MGO cooler HE-007 has to be opened when the
engine is switched from HFO to MDO/MGO operation.
That way, the MDO/MGO, which was heated while circulating via the injec-
tion pumps, is re-cooled before it is returned to the mixing tank T-011.
Switching on the MDO/MGO cooler may be effected only after flushing the
pipes with MDO/MGO.
The MDO/MGO cooler is cooled by LT cooling water.
The thermal design of the cooler is based on the following data:
```
```
Pc = P 1 x brISO x f 1
```
```
Qc = P 1 x brISO x f 2

Note:
In case more than one engine, or different engines are connected to the same fuel system, the cooler capacity has to
be increased accordingly.
1) This temperature has to be normally maximum 45 °C. Only for very light MGO fuel types this temperature has to be
even lower in order to preserve the minimum admissible fuel viscosity in engine inlet (see section Viscosity-tempera-
ture diagram (VT diagram), Page 249).
2) The maximum MDO/MGO throughput is identical to the delivery quantity of the installed booster pump.

PCV-011/Spill valve
```
```
Spill valve PCV-011 is not required.
```
```
In case two engines are operated with one fuel module, it has to be possible
to separate one engine at a time from the fuel circuit for maintenance purpo-
ses. In order to avoid a pressure increase in the pressurised system, the fuel,
which cannot circulate through the shut-off engine, has to be rerouted via
this valve into the return pipe. This valve is to be adjusted so that rerouting is
effected only when the pressure, in comparison to normal operation (multi-
engine operation), is exceeded. This valve should be designed as a pressure
relief valve, not as a safety valve.
```
```
V-002/Shut-off cock
```
```
Shut-off cock V-002 is not required.
```
```
The stop cock is closed during normal operation (multi-engine operation).
When one engine is separated from the fuel circuit for maintenance purpo-
ses, this cock has to be opened manually.
```
```
T-008/Fuel oil damper tank
```
```
The injection nozzles cause pressure peaks in the pressurised part of the fuel
system. In order to protect the viscosity measuring and control unit, these
pressure peaks have to be equalised by a compensation tank. The volume of
the pressure peaks compensation tank is 20 I.
```
```
Piping

```
We recommend to use pipes according to PN16 for the fuel system (see
section Engine pipe connections and dimensions, Page 267).

Engine operation during short blackout
```
```
Engines with conventional fuel injection system: The air pressure cushion in
the mixing tank is sufficient to press fuel from the mixing tank in the engine
for a short time.
Engines with common rail injection system: The feeder pump has to be con-
nected to a safe electrical grid, or an additional air driven booster pump is to
be installed in front of the mixing tank.
```
```
Starting during blackout
```
```
Engines with conventional fuel injection system: The engine can start by use
of a gravity fuel oil tank (MDO/MGO).
Engines with common rail injection system: Supply and booster pump are to
be connected to a save electrical grid, or both pumps are to be air driven. As
an alternative it is also possible to install in parallel to the main fuel oil system
an MDO/MGO emergency pump. This pump shall be electrically driven and
connected to a save electrical grid, or it shall be air driven.
Note:
A fast filling of hot high pressure injection pumps with cold MDO/MGO
shortly after HFO-operation will lead to temperature shocks in the injection
system and has to be avoided under any circumstances.
Blackout and/or black start procedures are to be designed in a way, that
emergency pumps will supply cold, low viscosity fuel to the engines only
after a sufficient blending with hot HFO, e.g. in the mixing tank.

### 5.5 Compressed air system

### 5.5.1 Starting air system

```
Marine main engines
```
```
The compressed air supply to the engine plant requires air vessels and air
compressors of a capacity and air delivery rating which will meet the require-
ments of the relevant classification society (see section Starting air vessels,
compressors, Page 354).
```
```
1 C-001, 2 C-001/Air compressor
```
```
1 service compressor 1 C-001
1 auxiliary compressor 2 C-001
These are multi-stage compressor sets with safety valves, cooler for com-
pressed air and condensate traps.
The operational compressor is switched on by the pressure control at low
pressure then switched off when maximum service pressure is attained.
A max. service pressure of 30 bar is required. The standard design pressure
of the starting air vessels is 30 bar and the design temperature is 50 °C.
The service compressor is electrically driven, the auxiliary compressor may
also be driven by a diesel engine. The capacity of both compressors (1
C-001 and 2 C-001) is identical.
The total capacity of the compressors has to be increased if the engine is
equipped with Jet Assist. This can be met either by providing a larger service
compressor, or by an additional compressor (3 C-001).
For special operating conditions such as, e.g., dredging service, the capacity
of the compressors has to be adjusted to the respective requirements of
operation.
```
```
1 T-007, 2 T-007/Starting air vessels
```
```
The installation situation of the air vessels must ensure a good drainage of
condensed water. Air vessels must be installed with a downward slope suffi-
ciently to ensure a good drainage of accumulated condensate water.
The installation also has to ensure that during emergency discharging of the
safety valve no persons can be compromised.
It is not permissible to weld supports (or other) on the air vessels. The original
design must not be altered. Air vessels are to be bedded and fixed by use of
external supporting structures.
```
```
Piping
```
```
The main starting pipe (engine connection 7171), connected to both air ves-
sels, leads to the main starting valve (MSV- 001) of the engine.
A second 30 bar pressure line (engine connection 7172) with separate con-
nections to both air vessels supplies the engine with control air. This does
not require larger air vessels.

350 (451) MAN 32/40 IMO Tier III, Project Guide – Marine, EN


```
A line branches off the aforementioned control air pipe to supply other air-
consuming engine accessories (e.g. lube oil automatic filter, fuel oil filter) with
compressed air through a separate 30/8 bar pressure reducing station.
A third 30 bar pipe is required for engines with Jet Assist (engine connection
7177 ). Depending on the air vessel arrangement, this pipe can be branched
off from the starting air pipe near engine or must be connected separately to
the air vessel for Jet Assist.
The pipes to be connected by the shipyard have to be supported immedi-
ately behind their connection to the engine. Further supports are required at
sufficiently short distance.
Flexible connections for starting air (steel tube type) have to be installed with
elastic fixation. The elastic mounting is intended to prevent the hose from
oscillating. For detail information please refer to planning and final documen-
tation and manufacturer manual.
Other air consumers for low pressure, auxiliary application (e.g. filter cleaning,
TC cleaning, pneumatic drives) can be connected to the start air system after
a pressure reduction unit.
Galvanised steel pipe must not be used for the piping of the system.
```
```
General requirements of classification societies
```
```
The equipment provided for starting the engines must enable the engines to
be started from the operating condition 'zero' with shipboard facilities, i. e.
without outside assistance.
Two or more starting air compressors must be provided. At least one of the
air compressors must be driven independently of the main engine and must
supply at least 50 % of the required total capacity.
The total capacity of the starting air compressors is to be calculated so that
the air volume necessary for the required number of starts is topped up from
atmospheric pressure within one hour.
The compressor capacities are calculated as follows:
```
##### P

```
[Nm^3 /h]
```
```
Total volumetric delivery capacity of the compressors
```
```
V
[litres]
```
```
Total volume of the starting air vessels at 30 bar service pres-
sure
```
```
As a rule, compressors of identical ratings should be provided. An emer-
gency compressor, if provided, is to be disregarded in this respect.
The starting air supply is to be split up into not less than two starting air ves-
sels of about the same size, which can be used independently of each other.
For the sizes of the starting air vessels for the respective engines see section
Starting air vessels, compressors, Page 354.
Diesel-mechanical main engine
For each non-reversible main engine driving a controllable pitch propeller, or
where starting without counter torque is possible, the stored starting air must
be sufficient for a certain number of starting manoeuvres, normally 6 per

engine. The exact number of required starting manoeuvres depends on the
arrangement of the system and on the special requirements of the classifica-
tion society.
Diesel-electric auxiliary engine
For auxiliary marine engines, separate air tanks shall only be installed if the
auxiliary sets in engine-driven vessels are installed far away from the main
plant.
Electric propulsion main engine
For each main engine for electrical propulsion the stored starting air must be
sufficient for a certain number of starting manoeuvres, normally 6 per engine.
The exact number of required starting manoeuvres depends on the number
of engines and on the special requirements of the classification society.

```
```
If other consumers (i.e. auxiliary engines, ship air etc.) which are not listed in
the formula are connected to the starting air vessel, the capacity of starting
air vessel must be increased accordingly, or an additional separate air vessel
has to be installed.

### 5.5.2 Starting air vessels, compressors

```
General
```
```
The engine requires compressed air for starting, start-turning, for the Jet
Assist function as well as several pneumatic controls. The design of the pres-
sure air vessel directly depends on the air consumption and the requirements
of the classification societies.
For air consumption see section Starting air/control air consumption, Page
93.
▪ The air consumption per starting manoeuvre depends on the inertia
moment of the unit. For alternator plants, 1.5 times the air consumption
per starting manoeuvre has to be expected.
▪ The air consumption per Jet Assist activation is substantially determined
by the respective turbocharger design. The special feature for common
rail engines, called Boost Injection, has reduced the Jet Assist events
that are relevant for the layout of starting air vessels and compressors
considerably. For more information concerning Jet Assist see section Jet
Assist, Page 357.
▪ The above-mentioned air consumption per Jet Assist activation is valid
for a jet duration of 5 seconds. The jet duration may vary between 3 sec.
and 10 sec., depending on the loading (average jet duration 5 sec.). The
air consumption is substantially determined by the respective turbo-
charger design. For more information concerning Jet Assist see section
Jet Assist, Page 357.
▪ The air consumption per slow-turn activation depends on the inertia
moment of the unit.

```
### 5.5.3 Jet Assist

```
General
```
```
Jet Assist is a system for acceleration of the turbocharger. By means of noz-
zles in the turbocharger, compressed air is directed to accelerate the com-
pressor wheel. This causes the turbocharger to adapt more rapidly to a new
load condition and improves the response of the engine.
```
```
Air consumption
```
```
The air consumption for Jet Assist is, to a great extent, dependent on the
load profile of the ship. In case of frequently and quickly changing load steps,
Jet Assist will be actuated more often than this will be the case during long
routes at largely constant load.
For air consumption (litre) see section Starting air vessels, compressors,
Page 354.
```
```
General data
```
Jet Assist air pressure (overpressure) 4 bar:
At the engine connection the pressure is max. 30 bar. The air pressure will
reduced on the engine by an orifice to max. 4 bar (overpressure).
Jet Assist activating time:
3 seconds to 10 seconds (5 seconds in average).

```
Dynamic positioning for drilling vessels, cable-laying vessels, off-shore
applications
```
```
When applying dynamic positioning, pulsating load application of > 25 %
may occur frequently, up to 30 times per hour. In these cases, the possibility
of a specially adapted, separate compressed air system has always to be
checked.
```
```
Air supply
```
```
Generally, larger air bottles are to be provided for the air supply of the Jet
Assist.
For the design of the Jet Assist air supply the temporal distribution of events
needs to be considered, if there might be an accumulation of events.
If the planned load profile is expecting a high requirement of Jet Assist, it
should be checked whether an air supply from the working air circuit, a sepa-
rate air bottle or a specially adapted, separate compressed air system is nec-
essary or reasonable.
In each case the delivery capacity of the compressors is to be adapted to the
expected Jet Assist requirement per unit of time.
```
### 5.6 Engine room ventilation and combustion air

```
General information
```
```
Its purpose is:
▪ Supplying the engines and auxiliary boilers with combustion air.
▪ Carrying off the radiant heat from all installed engines and auxiliaries.
The combustion air must be free from spray water, snow, dust and oil mist.
This is achieved by:
▪ Louvres, protected against the head wind, with baffles in the back and
optimally dimensioned suction space so as to reduce the air flow velocity
to 1 – 1.5 m/s.
▪ Self-cleaning air filter in the suction space (required for dust-laden air, e.
g. cement, ore or grain carrier).
▪ Sufficient space between the intake point and the openings of exhaust
air ducts from the engine and separator room as well as vent pipes from
lube oil and fuel oil tanks and the air intake louvres (the influence of winds
must be taken into consideration).
▪ Positioning of engine room doors on the ship's deck so that no oil-laden
air and warm engine room air will be drawn in when the doors are open.
▪ Arranging the separator station at a sufficiently large distance from the
turbochargers.
As a standard, the engines are equipped with turbochargers with air intake
silencers and the intake air is normally drawn in from the engine room.
In tropical service a sufficient volume of air must be supplied to the turbo-
charger(s) at outside air temperature. For this purpose there must be an air
duct installed for each turbocharger, with the outlet of the duct facing the
respective intake air silencer, separated from the latter by a space of 1.5 m.

```
358 (451) MAN 32/40 IMO Tier III, Project Guide – Marine, EN


```
No water of condensation from the air duct must be permissible to be drawn
in by the turbocharger. The air stream must not be directed onto the exhaust
manifold.
In intermittently or permanently arctic service (defined as: air intake tempera-
ture of the engine below +5 °C) special measures are necessary depending
on the possible minimum air intake temperature. For further information see
section Engine operation under arctic conditions, Page 66 and the following.
If necessary, steam heated air preheaters must be provided.
Please be aware that for an air intake pipe (plant side) directly connected to
the compressor inlet of the turbocharger following needs to be considered:
▪ Instead of air intake silencer an air intake casing needs to be ordered.
▪ The air intake pipe (plant side) needs to be separated by an expansion
joint from the turbocharger in order to prevent the transmission of forces
to the turbocharger itself. These forces include those resulting from the
weight, thermal expansion or lateral displacement of the exhaust piping.
▪ An insulation of the air intake pipe (plant side) should allow acces to the
installed sensors.
For the required combustion air quantity, see section Planning data for emis-
sion standard, Page 96. For the required combustion air quality, see section
Specification of intake air (combustion air), Page 261.
Cross sections of air supply ducts are to be designed to obtain the following
air flow velocities:
▪ Main ducts 8 – 12 m/s
▪ Secondary ducts max. 8 m/s
Air fans are to be designed so as to maintain a positive air pressure of 50 Pa
(5 mm WC) in the engine room.
The heat radiated from the main and auxiliary engines, from the exhaust
manifolds, waste heat boilers, silencers, alternators, compressors, electrical
equipment, steam and condensate pipes, heated tanks and other auxiliaries
is absorbed by the engine room air.
The amount of air V required to carry off this radiant heat can be calculated
as follows:
```
```
V [m^3 /h] Air required
Q [kJ/h] Heat to be dissipated
Δt [°C] Air temperature rise in engine room (10 – 12.5)
cp [kJ/
kg*k]
```
```
Specific heat capacity of air (1.01)
```
```
ρt [kg/m^3 ] Air density at 35 °C (1.15)
```
```
The capacity of the air ventilators (without separator room) must be large
enough to cover at least the sum of the following tasks:
▪ The combustion air requirements of all consumers.
▪ The air required for carrying off the radiant heat.
A rule-of-thumb applicable to plants operating on heavy fuel oil is 20 –
24 m^3 /kWh.

### 5.7 Exhaust gas system

### 5.7.1 General

```
As the flow resistance in the exhaust system has a very large influence on the
fuel consumption and the thermal load of the engine, the total resistance of
the exhaust gas system must not exceed 50 mbar.
Note:
20 mbar resistance for the SCR as part of the total resistance have to be
considered.
The pipe diameter selection depends on the engine output, the exhaust gas
volume, and the system backpressure, including silencer and SCR (if fitted).
The backpressure also being dependent on the length and arrangement of
the piping as well as the number of bends. Sharp bends result in very high
flow resistance and should therefore be avoided. If necessary, pipe bends
must be provided with guide vanes.
It is recommended not to exceed a maximum exhaust gas velocity of
approximately 40 m/s.
When installing the exhaust system, the following points must be observed:
▪ The exhaust pipes of two or more engines must not be joined.
▪ Because of the high temperatures involved, the exhaust pipes must be
able to expand. The expansion joints to be provided for this purpose are
to be mounted between fixed-point pipe supports installed in suitable
positions. One compensator is required just after the outlet casing of the
turbocharger (see section Position of the outlet casing of the turbo-
charger, Page 393) in order to prevent the transmission of forces to the
turbocharger itself. These forces include those resulting from the weight,
thermal expansion or lateral displacement of the exhaust piping. For this
compensator/expansion joint one sturdy fixed-point support must be
provided.
▪ The exhaust piping should be elastically hung or supported by means of
dampers in order to prevent the transmission of sound to other parts of
the vessel.
▪ The exhaust piping is to be provided with water drains, which are to be
regularly checked to drain any condensation water or possible leak water
from exhaust gas boilers if fitted.
▪ During commissioning and maintenance work, checking of the exhaust
gas system back pressure by means of a temporarily connected measur-
ing device may become necessary. For this purpose, a measuring socket
is to be provided approximately 1 to 2 metres after the exhaust gas out-
let of the turbocharger, in a straight length of pipe at an easily accessed
position. Standard pressure measuring devices usually require a measur-
ing socket size of 1/2". This measuring socket is to be provided to
ensure back pressure can be measured without any damage to the
exhaust gas pipe insulation.

### 5.7.2 Components and assemblies of the exhaust gas system

```
Exhaust gas silencer and exhaust gas boiler
```
```
The silencer operates on the absorption and resonance principle so it is
effective in a wide frequency band. The flow path, which runs through the
silencer in a straight line, ensures optimum noise reduction with minimum
flow resistance.
The silencer must be equipped with a spark arrestor.
If possible, the silencer should be installed towards the end of the exhaust
line.
A vertical installation situation is to be preferred in order to avoid formations
of gas fuel pockets in the silencer. The cleaning ports of the spark arrestor
are to be easily accessible.
Note:
Water entry into the silencer and/or boiler must be avoided, as this can
cause damages of the components (e.g. forming of deposits) in the duct.
To utilise the thermal energy from the exhaust, an exhaust gas boiler produc-
ing steam or hot water may be installed.
The exhaust gas system (from outlet of turbocharger, boiler, silencer to the
outlet stack) is to be insulated to reduce the external surface temperature to
the required level.
The relevant provisions concerning accident prevention and those of the
classification societies must be observed.
The insulation is also required to avoid temperatures below the dew point on
the interior side. In case of insufficient insulation intensified corrosion and
soot deposits on the interior surface are the consequence. During fast load
changes, such deposits might flake off and be entrained by exhaust in the
form of soot flakes.
Insulation and covering of the compensator must not restrict its free move-
ment.
```
### 5.8 SCR system

## 5.8.1 General

```
The SCR system uses aqueous urea solution and a catalyst material to trans-
form the pollutant nitrogen oxides into harmless nitrogen and water vapor.
The main components of the SCR system are described in the following sec-
tion.

## 5.8.2 As-delivered conditions and packaging

```
All components will be delivered and packaged in a seaworthy way (with dry
agent, wooden boxing, shrink wrapped). Black carbon steel components will
be coated with an anti-corrosive painting. Stainless steel components will not
be coated.
The original packaging should not be removed until the date of installation.
The physical integrity of the packaging must be checked at the date of deliv-
ery.
```
## 5.8.3 Transportation and handling

lets.
Using a vertical way, the two cables each fixed on one metal eyelet have to
be stabilised by a transversal bar.

## 5.8.4 Storage

```
Compressed air reservoir module (MOD‐085), urea pump module
(MOD‐084), dosing unit (MOD‐082), SCR control unit and sensor elements
have to be stored in dry and weather‐resistant conditions.
Catalyst elements shall be handled free from shocks and vibrations. Further-
more, catalyst elements have to be stored in dry and weather‐resistant con-
ditions. Keep oils or chemicals away from catalyst elements. Seaworthy
packaging is only a temporary protection.
```
## 5.8.5 Components and assemblies of the SCR system

```
Catalyst elements
```
```
The catalyst elements are placed in metallic frames, so called modules. Due
to the honeycomb structure of the catalyst elements, the catalytic surface is
increased. The active component Vanadium pentoxide (V 2 O 5 ) in the surface
supports the reduction of NOx to harmless nitrogen.
The effectivity of the catalytic material decreases over time because of poi-
soning via fuel oil components or thermal impact. The durability depends on
the fuel type and conditions of operation.
The status of catalyst deactivation is monitored continuously and the amount
of urea injected is adapted according to the current status of the catalyst.
```
```
Compressed air reservoir module (MOD-085) and soot blowing system
(MOD-086)
```
```
The compressed air required for the operation of the SCR system is provided
by the compressed air module. It receives its compressed air via the ship ́s
compressed air grid. For the quality requirements read section Specification
of compressed air, Page 263. The main supply line feeds the compressed air
reservoir module, where a compressed air tank is installed. This high-pres-
sure tank is a reservoir with enough capacity to ensure the supply of the dos-
ing unit and the air consumption for the periodically cleaning of the catalysts ́
surface, by avoiding fluctuations in the soot blowing system. In case of black
out the volume of the tank will be used for flushing the urea line and nozzle.
The module has to be positioned close to the reactor and the dosing unit.
The maximum length of the compressed air line to the soot blowing system
is 10 m.
The soot blower valves are positioned upstream each catalyst layer in order
to clean the complete surface of the catalyst elements by periodical air flush-
ing. The soot blowing always has to be in operation while engine running.
```
```
Urea pump modul (MOD-084)
```
```
The urea pump module boosts urea to the dosing unit and maintains an ade-
quate pressure in the urea lines. The complete module is mounted in a
standard cabinet for wall fastening. Upstream of the supply pump, a filter is
installed for protection of solid pollutants. Downstream, the module is equip-
ped with a return line to the urea storage tank with a pressure relief valve to
ensure the required urea flow.

**5.8 SCR system**

```
MAN 32/40 IMO Tier III, Project Guide – Marine, EN 363 (451)
```

```
The urea pump module has to be positioned on a level below the minimum
urea level of the urea storage tank. The pump accepts a maximum pressure
loss of 2 bars. One urea pump module can supply up to four SCR systems.
Note:
Urea quality according section Specification of urea solution, Page 264 is
required. For urea consumption calculation for Tier III read section Urea con-
sumption for emission standard IMO Tier III, Page 91.
```
```
Dosing unit (MOD-082)
```
```
The dosing unit controls the flow of urea to the injection nozzle based on the
operation of the engine. Furthermore it regulates the compressed air flow to
the injector.
In order to avoid clogging due to the evaporation of urea in the urea pipe and
in the nozzle, a line between compressed air line and urea line is installed. An
installed solenoid valve will open to flush and cool the urea line and nozzle
with compressed air before and after injecting urea into the exhaust gas.
The dosing unit has to be installed close to the urea injection lance and mix-
ing unit (maximum pipe length 5 m).
```
```
Urea injection lance and mixing unit (MOD-087)
```
```
The urea solution will be injected into the exhaust gas using a two-phase
nozzle. The urea will be atomised with compressed air. The evaporation of
the urea occurs immediately when the urea solution gets in contact with the
hot exhaust gas.
The urea injection and the mixing unit have to be positioned according to
MAN Diesel & Turbo requirements. In general, the mixing section is between
3.0 – 4.5 m long and of DN 500 to DN 2,300. The mixing duct is a straight
pipe upstream of the reactor. The exact length has to be calculated. Addi-
tional, it has to be considered that an inlet zone upstream the reactor of
0.5 x diameter of the exhaust gas pipe has to be foreseen.
```
```
SCR reactor (R-001)
```
```
Each engine is equipped with its own SCR reactor and it is fitted in the
exhaust gas piping without a by-pass. The SCR reactor housing is a steel
structure with an inlet cone. The reactor configuration is vertical and consists
of several layers of catalysts. For horizontal installation, please contact MAN
Diesel & Turbo. The reactor is equipped with differential pressure and tem-
perature monitoring, openings for inspection, a maintenance door for service
and the soot blowing system for each layer.
The maximum temperature of the exhaust gas is 450 °C and a minimum
exhaust gas temperature is required to ensure a reliable operation. Therefore
temperature indicators are installed in the inlet and outlet of the reactor in
order to monitor and control the optimum operating range.

## 5.8.6 Installation of the SCR system

```
All modules are check regarding pressure and tightness.
For handling the catalyst elements sufficient space and supply tracks have to
be foreseen. Depending on the amount of catalyst elements transport devi-
ces like carriages, pulleys, fork lifter or elevators are required.
A service space of recommended 800 mm in front of the inspection doors of
the reactor for mounting and dismounting the catalyst elements has to be
foreseen. Further 750 mm space for service and maintenance of the soot
blower equipment and the differential pressure device has to be considered
according the installation side of the soot blowing system.
In case of a bend before the reactor inlet, a straight inlet duct to the reactor
of 0.5 times exhaust gas pipe diameter and a bend radius of 1.5 times
exhaust gas pipe diameters has to be considered.
The mixing unit is designed for vertical or horizontal installation. Bend on the
downstream side has to be in accordance to above mentioned “Reactor and
Piping”. Upstream of the mixing unit a bend can be installed according the
MAN Diesel & Turbo requirements mentioned on the planning drawing.
```
## 5.8.7 Recommendations

```
All parts mentioned in this paragraph are not MAN Diesel & Turbo scope of
supply.
All piping's have to be in accordance to section Specification of materials for
piping, Page 267. Piping for fluids shall be mounted in an increasing/
decreasing way. Siphons should be avoided, drainage system be foreseen.
The complete inside wall of the exhaust gas piping between engine outlet
and SCR reactor inlet should not be coated by any protection material. Poi-
soning of the catalyst honeycombs could occur.
All materials used for the construction of tanks and containers including
tubes, valves and fittings for storage, transportation and handling must be
compatible with urea 40 % solution to avoid any contamination of urea and
corrosion of device used. In order to guarantee the urea quality the following
materials for tank, pipes and fittings are compatible: Stainless steel (1.4301
or 1.4509) or urea-resistant plastics (e.g. PA12). For gaskets EPDM or
HNBR. Piping for compressed air see section Specification of materials for
piping, Page 267.
Unsuitable materials for tank, pipes and fittings are among others: aluminum,
unalloyed steel, galvanised steel, copper and brass.
In case incompatible material is used, clogging of urea filter inside the pump
module may occur, or even worse, the catalyst elements may be damaged
by catalyst poisons derived from this material. In this case, exchanging the
catalyst modules may be necessary.
Store this material in cool, dry, well-ventilated areas. Do not store at temper-
atures below 10 °C and above 55 °C. The storage capacity of the urea tank
should be designed depending on ship load profile and bunker cycle.

The urea supply line should be provided with a strainer and a non-return
valve in order to assure a correct performance for the suction of the urea
pump, which is installed downstream the tank. A level switch with the possi-
bility to read out the signal will protect the pump of a dry run. A return line
from the urea pump module over a pressure relief valve is entering the tank.
Use of good quality urea is essential for the operation of an SCR catalyst.
Using urea not complying with the specification below e.g. agricultural urea,
can either cause direct operational problems or long term problems like
deactivation of the catalyst. For quality requirements, see section Specifica-
tion of urea solution, Page 264.
The quality of the insulation has to be in accordance with the safety require-
ments. All insulations for service and maintenance spaces have to be dis-
mountable. The delivered modules have no fixations, if fixations are neces-
sary take care about the permissible material combination. Regarding max.
permissible thermal loss see section Boundary conditions for SCR operation,
Page 25.
Water entry into the reactor housing must be avoided, as this can cause
damage and clogging of the catalyst. Therefore a water trap has to be instal-
led, if the exhaust pipe downstream of the SCR reactor is facing upwards.

## 6.1.1 General details

```
Apart from a functional arrangement of the components, the shipyard is to
provide for an engine room layout ensuring good accessibility of the compo-
nents for servicing.
The cleaning of the cooler tube bundle, the emptying of filter chambers and
subsequent cleaning of the strainer elements, and the emptying and cleaning
of tanks must be possible without any problem whenever required.
All of the openings for cleaning on the entire unit, including those of the
exhaust silencers, must be accessible.
There should be sufficient free space for temporary storage of pistons, cam-
shafts, turbocharger etc. dismounted from the engine. Additional space is
required for the maintenance personnel. The panels on the engine sides for
inspection of the bearings and removal of components must be accessible
without taking up floor plates or disconnecting supply lines and piping. Free
space for installation of a torsional vibration meter should be provided at the
crankshaft end.
A very important point is that there should be enough room for storing and
handling vital spare parts so that replacements can be made without loss of
time.
In planning marine installations with two or more engines driving one propel-
ler shaft through a multiengine transmission gear, provision must be made
for a minimum clearance between the engines because the crankcase pan-
els of each engine must be accessible. Moreover, there must be free space
on both sides of each engine for removing pistons or cylinder liners.
Note:
MAN Diesel & Turbo delivered scope of supply is to be arranged and fixed by
proven technical experiences as per state of the art. Therefore the technical
requirements have to be taken in consideration as described in the following

## 6.1.5 Lifting device

```
Lifting gear with varying lifting capacities are to be provided for servicing and
repair work on the engine, turbocharger and charge air cooler.
```
```
Engine
```
```
An overhead travelling crane is required which has a lifting power equal to
the heaviest component that has to be lifted during servicing of the engine.
The overhead travelling crane can be chosen with the aid of the following
table.
```
```
Parameter Unit Value
Cylinder head with valves kg tbd.
Piston with connecting shaft/head tbd.
Cylinder liner tbd.
Recommended lifting capacity of travelling crane1) 1,000
1) Without consideration of classification rules.
```
```
Table 179: Lifting capacity
```
```
Crane arrangement
```
```
The rails for the crane are to be arranged in such a way that the crane can
cover the whole of the engine beginning at the exhaust pipe.
The hook position must reach along the engine axis, past the centreline of
the first and the last cylinder, so that valves can be dismantled and installed
without pulling at an angle. Similarly, the crane must be able to reach the tie
rod at the ends of the engine. In cramped conditions, eyelets must be wel-
ded under the deck above, to accommodate a lifting pulley.
The required crane capacity is to be determined by the crane supplier.
It is necessary that:
▪ there is an arresting device for securing the crane while hoisting if operat-
ing in heavy seas
▪ there is a two-stage lifting speed
Precision hoisting approximately = 0.5 m/min
Normal hoisting approximately = 2 – 4 m/min
In planning the arrangement of the crane, a storage space must be provided
in the engine room for the dismantled engine components which can be
reached by the crane. It should be capable of holding two rocker arm cas-
ings, two cylinder covers and two pistons. If the cleaning and service work is
to be carried out here, additional space for cleaning troughs and work surfa-
ces should be planned.
Grinding of valve cones and valve seats is carried out in the workshop or in a
neighbouring room.
Transport rails and appropriate lifting tackle are to be provided for the further
transport of the complete cylinder cover from the storage space to the work-
shop. For the necessary deck openings, see following figures and tables.

Turbocharger
```
```
A hoisting rail with a mobile trolley is to be provided over the centre of the
turbocharger running parallel to its axis, into which a lifting tackle is suspen-
ded with the relevant lifting power for lifting the parts, which are mentioned in
the tables (see paragraph Lifting capacity, Page 387), to carry out the opera-
tions according to the maintenance schedule.

388) is required for separating the silencer from the turbocharger. The
silencer must be shifted axially by this distance before it can be moved later-
ally.
In addition to this measure, another 100 mm are required for assembly clear-
ance.

```
This is the minimum distance between silencer and bulkhead or tween-deck.
We recommend to plan additional 300 – 400 mm as working space.
Make sure that the silencer can be removed either downwards or upwards or
laterally and set aside, to make the turbocharger accessible for further servic-
ing. Pipes must not be laid in these free spaces.
```
```
Fan shafts
```
```
The engine combustion air is to be supplied towards the intake silencer in a
duct ending at a point 1.5 m away from the silencer inlet. If this duct impedes
the maintenance operations, for instance the removal of the silencer, the end
section of the duct must be removable. Suitable suspension lugs are to be
provided on the deck and duct.
```
```
Gallery
```
```
If possible the ship deck should reach up to both sides of the turbocharger
(clearance 50 mm) to obtain easy access for the maintenance personnel.
Where deck levels are unfavourable, suspended galleries are to be provided.
```
```
Charge air cooler
```
```
For cleaning of the charge air cooler bundle, it must be possible to lift it verti-
cally out of the cooler casing and lay it in a cleaning bath.
Exception MAN 32/40: The cooler bundle of this engine is drawn out at the
end. Similarly, transport onto land must be possible.
For lifting and transportation of the bundle, a lifting rail is to be provided
which runs in transverse or longitudinal direction to the engine (according to
the available storage place), over the centreline of the charge air cooler, from
which a trolley with hoisting tackle can be suspended.

## 6.2.2 General details for Tier III SCR system duct arrangement

```
MAN Diesel & Turbo recommends that the SCR reactor housing should be
mounted before all other components (e.g. boiler, silencer) in the exhaust
duct, coming from the engine side. A painting on the inside wall of the
exhaust duct in front of the the SCR system is not allowed.

```

```
All of the spaces/openings for cleaning and maintenance on the entire unit,
including air reservoir module, dosing unit and reactor housing with soot-
blowers must be accessible.
We strongly recommend that in front of the reactor housing sufficient space
for the maintenance personal and/or for the temporary storage of the catalyst
honeycombs has to be foreseen (see section SCR System, Page 361).
Catalyst elements could reach a weight of 25 kg, the reactor openings could
reach a total weight of about 70 kg, MAN Diesel & Turbo strongly recom-
mends a lifting capability above the reactors.
A very important point is the transportation way and storage space of the
catalyst honeycombs within the funnel for supply of the SCR reactor during
maintenance or catalyst refreshment, one reactor could contain more than
100 elements.
To avoid time-consuming or implementation of a scaffolding, MAN Diesel &
Turbo strongly recommends at minimum a lifting device in the funnel or any
kind of material elevator. A porthole from outside rooms on level with the
reactor housing is also a possibility, as far as those rooms could be supplied
with the catalyst honeycombs.

culated with the class notation "No Ice" and high skew propeller blade
design. These propulsion packages are examples of different combinations
of engines, gearboxes, propellers and shaft lines according to the design
parameters above. Due to different and individual aft ship body designs and
operational profiles your inquiry and order will be carefully reviewed and all
given parameters will be considered in an individual calculation. The result of
this calculation can differ from the standard propulsion packages by the
assumption of e.g. a higher Ice Class or different design parameters.

## 7.4 Propeller clearance

```
To reduce the emitted pressure impulses and vibrations from the propeller to
the hull, MAN Diesel & Turbo recommend a minimum tip clearance see sec-
tion Recommended configuration of foundation, Page 185.
For ships with slender aft body and favourable inflow conditions the lower
values can be used whereas full after body and large variations in wake field
causes the upper values to be used.
In twin-screw ships the blade tip may protrude below the base line.

## 8 Electric propulsion plants

## 8.1 Advantages of diesel-electric propulsion

```
Due to different and individual types, purposes and operational profiles of
diesel-electric driven vessels the design of an electric propulsion plant differs
a lot and has to be evaluated case by case. All the following is for information
purpose only and without obligation.
In general the advantages of electric propulsion can be summarized as fol-
lows:
▪ Lower fuel consumption and emissions due to the possibility to optimize
the loading of diesel engines/GenSets. The GenSets in operation can run
on high loads with high efficiency. This applies especially to vessels
which have a large variation in power demand, for example for an off-
shore supply vessel.
▪ High reliability, due to multiple engine redundancy. Even if an engine/
GenSet malfunctions, there will be sufficient power to operate the vessel
safely. Reduced vulnerability to single point of failure providing the basis
to fulfill high redundancy requirements.
▪ Reduced life cycle cost, resulting from lower operational and mainte-
nance costs.
▪ Improved manoeuvrability and station-keeping ability, by deploying spe-
cial propulsors such as azimuth thrusters or pods. Precise control of the
electric propulsion motors controlled by frequency converters.
▪ Increased payload, as diesel-electric propulsion plants take less engine
room space.
▪ More flexibility in location of diesel engine/GenSets and propulsors. The
propulsors are supplied with electric power through cables. They do not
need to be adjacent to the diesel engines/GenSets.
▪ Low propulsion noise and reduced vibrations. For example, a slow speed
E-motor allows to avoid a gearbox and propulsors like pods keep most
of the structure bore noise outside of the hull.
▪ Efficient performance and high motor torques, as the system can provide
maximum torque also at slow propeller speeds, which gives advantages
for example in icy conditions.

## 8.5 Engine selection

```
The engines for a diesel-electric propulsion plant have to be selected accord-
ingly to the power demand at all the design points. For a concept evaluation
the rating, the capability and the loading of engines can be calculated like
this:
Example: Offshore supply vessel (at operation mode with the highest expec-
ted total load)
▪ Total propulsion power demand (at E-motor shaft) 10,000 kW (incl. sea
margin)
▪ Max. electrical consumer load: 1,000 kW

For the detailed selection of the type and number of engines furthermore the
operational profile of the vessel, the maintenance strategy of the engines and
the boundary conditions given by the general arrangement have to be con-
sidered. For the optimal cylinder configuration of the engines often the power
conditions in port are decisive.

## 8.6 E-plant, switchboard and alternator design

```
The configuration and layout of an electric propulsion plant, the main switch-
board and the alternators follows some basic design principles. For a con-
cept evaluation the following items should be considered:
▪ A main switchboard which is divided in symmetrical sections is very relia-
ble and redundancy requirements are easy to be met.
▪ An even number of GenSets/alternators ensures the symmetrical loading
of the bus bar sections.
▪ Electric consumers should be arranged symmetrically on the bus bar
sections.
▪ The switchboard design is mainly determined by the level of the short cir-
cuit currents which have to be withstand and by the breaking capacity of
the circuit breakers (CB).
▪ The voltage choice for the main switchboard depends on several factors.
On board of a vessel it is usually handier to use low voltage. Due to short
circuit restrictions the following table can be used for voltage choice as a
rule of thumb:
Total installed alternator power Voltage Breaking capacity of CB
< 10 – 12 MW
(and: Single propulsion motor < 3.5 MW)
```
```
440 V 100 kA
```
```
< 13 – 15 MW
(and: Single propulsion motor < 4.5 MW)
```
```
690 V 100 kA
```
```
< 48 MW 6,600 V 30 kA
```
```
< 130 MW 11,000 V 50 kA
Table 186: Rule of thumb for the voltage choice
```
```
▪ The design of the alternators and the electric plant always has to be bal-
anced between voltage choice, availability of reactive power, short circuit
level and allowed total harmonic distortion (THD).
▪ On the one hand side a small xd” of an alternator increases the short cir-
cuit current Isc”, which also increases the forces the switchboard has to
withstand (F ~ Isc” ^ 2). This may lead to the need of a higher voltage. On
the other side a small xd” gives a lower THD but a higher weight and a
bigger size of the alternator. As a rule of thumb a xd”=16 % is a good
figure for low voltage alternators and a xd”=14 % is good for medium
voltage alternators.
▪ For a rough estimation of the short circuit currents the following formulas
can be used:

```
▪ The choice of the type of the E-motor depends on the application. Usu-
ally induction motors are used up to a power of 7 MW (ηMotor: typically =
0.96). If it comes to applications above 7 MW per E-motor often synchro-
nous machines are used. Also in applications with slow speed E-motors
(without a reduction gearbox), for ice going or pod-driven vessels often
synchronous E-motors (ηMotor: typically = 0.97) are used.
▪ In plants with frequency converters based on VSI-technology (PWM type)
the converter itself can deliver reactive power to the E-motor. So often a
power factor cos φ = 0.9 is a good figure to design the alternator rating.
Nevertheless there has to be sufficient reactive power for the ship con-
sumers, so that a lack in reactive power does not lead to unnecessary
starts of (standby) alternators.
▪ The harmonics can be improved (if necessary) by using supply trans-
formers for the frequency converters with a 30 ° phase shift between the
two secondary windings, which cancel the dominant 5th and 7th harmonic
currents. Also an increase in the pulse number leads to lower THD. Using
a 12-pulse configuration with a PWM type of converter the resulting har-
monic distortion will normally be below the limits defined by the classifi-
cation societies. When using a transformer less solution with a converter
with an Active Front End (Sinusoidal input rectifier) or in a 6-pulse config-
uration usually THD-filters are necessary to mitigate the THD on the sub-
distributions.
The final layout of the electrical plant and the components has always to be
based on a detailed analysis and a calculation of the short circuit levels, the
load flows and the THD levels as well as on an economical evaluation.

## 8.7 Over-torque capability

```
In diesel-electric propulsion plants, which are operating with a fix pitch pro-
peller, the dimensioning of the electric propulsion motor has to be done
accurately, in order to have sufficient propulsion power available. For dimen-
sioning the electric motor it has to be investigated what amount of over-tor-
que, which directly defines the motor ́s cost, weight and space demand, is
required to operate the propeller with sufficient power also in situations,
where additional power is needed (for example because of heavy weather or
icy conditions).
Usually a constant power range of 5 – 10 % is applied on the propulsion
(Field weakening range), where constant E-motor power is available.

## 8.8 Power management

```
Power management system
```
```
The following main functions are typical for a power management system
(PMS):
▪ Automatic load dependent start/stop of GenSets/alternators
▪ Manual starting/stopping of GenSets/alternators
▪ Fault dependent start/stop of standby GenSets/alternators in cases of
under-frequency and/or under-voltage
▪ Start of GenSets/alternators in case of a blackout (black-start capability)
▪ Determining and selection of the starting/stopping sequence of GenSets/
alternators
▪ Start and supervise the automatic synchronization of alternators and bus
tie breakers
▪ Balanced and unbalanced load application and sharing between
GenSets/alternators. Often an emergency programme for quickest possi-
ble load acceptance is necessary.
▪ Regulation of the network frequency (with static droop or constant fre-
quency)
▪ Distribution of active load between alternators
▪ Distribution of reactive load between alternators
▪ Handling and blocking of heavy consumers
▪ Automatic load shedding
▪ Tripping of non-essential consumers
▪ Bus tie and breaker monitoring and control
All questions regarding the interfaces from/to the power management sys-
tem have to be clarified with MAN Diesel & Turbo at an early project stage.

## 8.9 Example configurations of electric propulsion plants

```
Offshore Support Vessels
```
```
The term “Offshore Service & Supply Vessel” includes a large class of vessel
types, such as Platform Supply Vessels (PSV), Anchor Handling/Tug/Supply
(AHTS), Offshore Construction Vessel (OCV), Diving Support Vessel (DSV),
Multipurpose Vessel, etc.
Electric propulsion is the norm in ships which frequently require dynamic
positioning and station keeping capability. Initially these vessels mainly used
variable speed motor drives and fixed pitch propellers. Now they mostly
deploy variable speed thrusters and they are also often equipped with hybrid
propulsion systems.
```
```
Figure 166: Example: Diesel-electric propulsion configuration of a PSV
```
```
In offshore applications often frequency converters with a 6-pulse configura-
tion or with an Active Front End are used, which give specific benefits in the
space consumption of the electric plant, as it is possible to get rid of the
heavy and bulky supply transformers.

LNG Carriers

A propulsion configuration with two E-motors (e.g. 600 RPM or 720 RPM)
and a reduction gearbox (Twin-in-single-out) is a typical configuration, which
is used at LNG carriers where the installed alternator power is in the range of
about 40 MW. The electric plant fulfils high redundancy requirements. Due to
the high propulsion power, which is required and higher efficiencies, mainly
synchronous E-motors are used.

Cruise and ferries
```
```
Passenger vessels – cruise ships and ferries – are an important application
field for diesel-electric propulsion. Safety and comfort are paramount. New
regulations, as “Safe Return to Port”, require a high reliable and redundant
electric propulsion plant and also onboard comfort is of high priority, allowing
only low levels of noise and vibration from the ship ́s machinery.
A typical electric propulsion plant is shown in the example below.

Low loss applications

As MAN Diesel & Turbo works together with different suppliers for diesel-
electric propulsion plants an optimal matched solution can be designed for
each application, using the most efficient components from the market. The
following example shows a low loss solution, patented by STADT AS (Nor-
way).
In many cases a combination of an E-propulsion motor, running on two con-
stants speeds (Medium, high) and a pitch controllable propeller (CPP) gives a
high reliable and compact solution.

## 8.10 High-efficient diesel-electric propulsion plants with variable speed GenSets (EPROX)

```
Recent developments in electric components, which are used in a diesel-
electric propulsion plant show solutions for a fuel-saving propulsion system.
For many years, electric propulsion employs alternating current (AC) for the
main switchboards. Since some years also direct current (DC) distributions
are applied here. In such a system the advantages of AC components, like
alternators and e-propulsion motors are combined with the DC distribution.
Just as the variable speed drives enable the e-propulsion motors to run at
their optimum working point, the DC distribution allows the diesel engines to
operate with variable speed for highest fuel-oil efficiency at each load level.
Such a system enables a decoupled operation of diesel engines, propulsion
drives and other consumers of electric power, where each power source and
consumer can be controlled and optimized independently.
```
```
Figure 171: Example: High-efficient electric propulsion plant based on a DC distribution; with integrated
batteries for energy storage
```
```
As a result constant speed operation for the GenSets is no longer a con-
straint. When the main gensets run at constant rpm with control of the power
delivered, fuel efficiency is compromised. Utilizing an enlarged engine opera-
tion map with a speed range of 60 % to 100 % paves the way to a high
potential in fuel oil saving. According to the total system load each engine
can operate at an individual speed set point, in order to achieve a minimum
in fuel oil consumption.

Another major advantage of the system is the possible integration of energy
storage devices, like batteries. They can reduce the transient loads on the
engines, improve the dynamic response and the manoeuvrability of the pro-
pulsion system and absorb rapid power fluctuations from the vessel ́s grid.
Fast load applications are removed from the engines and peak loads are
shaved.
It is also beneficial to run the engines always on high loads, where their spe-
cific fuel oil consumption is lowest. This degree of freedom can be utilized
and surplus power can charge the batteries. If less power is required, one
engine can be shut down, with the remaining ones running still with a high
loading, supported by power out of the batteries.

## 8.11 Fuel-saving hybrid propulsion system (HyProp ECO)

```
For many applications a hybrid propulsion system is a good choice, espe-
cially when flexibility, performance and efficiency are required. With HyProp
ECO a system solution has been developed, which combines a diesel engine
and an electric machine in a smart manner.

Figure 174: Principal layout of a HyProp ECO propulsion system
Beside the main diesel engine, the auxiliary GenSets, a 2-step reduction
gearbox and the CP propeller a reversible electric machine, a frequency con-
verter and a bypass are the key components of the system. With this many
operation modes can be achieved. When operating the system via the
bypass the normal PTO and PTI-boosting modes can be applied without any
losses in the transmission line to/from the main switchboard. Utilizing the fre-
quency converter is done for two different purposes. Either it is used for
starting-up the electric machine as emergency propulsion motor (PTH) in
case the main engine is off. Usually the 2nd step in the gearbox is then used.
Or the converter is of a bi-directional type and the propeller can be operated
very efficiently at combinator mode with the PTO running in parallel with the
auxiliary gensets with a constant voltage and frequency towards the main
switchboard. In this mode the converter can also be used for diesel-electric
propulsion as variable speed drive for the propeller.
The major advantage of HyProp ECO is that costly components, like the fre-
quency converter can be designed small. A typical figure for its size is 30 %
of the installed alternator/motor power as for almost all modes, where the
converter is involved, the required power is much lower compared to a
design for pure PTO/PTI purposes. Therefore HyProp ECO combines lowest
investment with optimized performance.

## 9 Annex

## 9.1 Safety instructions and necessary safety measures

```
The following list of basic safety instructions, in combination with further
engine documentation like user manual and working instructions, should
ensure a safe handling of the engine. Due to variations between specific
plants, this list does not claim to be complete and may vary with regard to
project specific requirements.
```
## 9.1.1 General

```
There are risks at the interfaces of the engine, which have to be eliminated or
minimised in the context of integrating the engine into the plant system.
Responsible for this is the legal person which is responsible for the integra-
tion of the engine.
```
```
Following prerequisites need to be fulfilled:
```
```
▪ Layout, calculation, design and execution of the plant have to be state of
the art.
▪ All relevant classification rules, regulations and laws are considered, eval-
uated and are included in the system planning.
▪ The project-specific requirements of MAN Diesel & Turbo regarding the
engine and its connection to the plant are implemented.
▪ In principle, the more stringent requirements of a specific document is
applied if its relevance is given for the plant.
```
## 9.1.2 Safety equipment and measures provided by plant-side

```
▪ Proper execution of the work
Generally, it is necessary to ensure that all work is properly done accord-
ing to the task trained and qualified personnel.
All tools and equipment must be provided to ensure adequate accesible
and safe execution of works in all life cycles of the plant.
Special attention must be paid to the execution of the electrical equip-
ment. By selection of suitable specialised companies and personnel, it
has to be ensured that a faulty feeding of media, electric voltage and
electric currents will be avoided.
▪ Fire protection
A fire protection concept for the plant needs to be executed. All from
safety considerations resulting necessary measures must be implemen-
ted. The specific remaining risks, e.g. the escape of flammable media
from leaking connections, must be considered.
Generally, any ignition sources, such as smoking or open fire in the main-
tenance and protection area of the engine is prohibited.
Smoke detection systems and fire alarm systems have to be installed
and in operation.
▪ Electrical safety
Standards and legislations for electrical safety have to be followed. Suita-
ble measures must be taken to avoid electrical short circuit, lethal electric
shocks and plant specific topics as static charging of the piping through
the media flow itself.

**9.1 Safety instructions and necessary safety measures**

```
MAN 32/40 IMO Tier III, Project Guide – Marine, EN 421 (451)
```

```
▪ Noise and vibration protection
The noise emission of the engine must be considered early in the plan-
ning and design phase. A soundproofing or noise encapsulation could be
necessary. The foundation must be suitable to withstand the engine
vibration and torque fluctuations. The engine vibration may also have an
impact on installations in the surrounding of the engine, as galleries for
maintenance next to the engine. Vibrations act on the human body and
may dependent on strength, frequency and duration harm health.
▪ Thermal hazards
In workspaces and traffic areas hot surfaces must be isolated or cov-
ered, so that the surface temperatures comply with the limits by stand-
ards or legislations.
▪ Composition of the ground
The ground, workspace, transport/traffic routes and storage areas have
to be designed according to the physical and chemical characteristics of
the excipients and supplies used in the plant.
Safe work for maintenance and operational staff must always be possi-
ble.
▪ Adequate lighting
Light sources for an adequate and sufficient lighting must be provided by
plant-side. The current guidelines should be followed (100 Lux is recom-
mended, see also DIN EN 1679-1).
▪ Working platforms/scaffolds
For work on the engine working platforms/scaffolds must be provided
and further safety precautions must be taken into consideration. Among
other things, it must be possible to work secured by safety belts. Corre-
sponding lifting points/devices have to be provided.
▪ Setting up storage areas
Throughout the plant, suitable storage areas have to be determined for
stabling of components and tools.
It is important to ensure stability, carrying capacity and accessibility. The
quality structure of the ground has to be considered (slip resistance,
resistance against residual liquids of the stored components, considera-
tion of the transport and traffic routes).
▪ Engine room ventilation
An effective ventilation system has to be provided in the engine room to
avoid endangering by contact or by inhalation of fluids, gases, vapours
and dusts which could have harmful, toxic, corrosive and/or acid effects.
▪ Venting of crankcase and turbocharger
The gases/vapours originating from crankcase and turbocharger are
ignitable. It must be ensured that the gases/vapours will not be ignited by
external sources. For multi-engine plants, each engine has to be ventila-
ted separately. The engine ventilation of different engines must not be
connected.
In case of an installed suction system, it has to be ensured that it will not
be stopped until at least 20 minutes after engine shutdown.
▪ Intake air filtering
In case air intake is realised through piping and not by means of the tur-
bocharger ́s intake silencer, appropriate measures for air filtering must be
provided. It must be ensured that particles exceeding 5 μm will be
restrained by an air filtration system.
9 Annex ▪ Quality of the intake air
```
**9.1 Safety instructions and necessary safety measures**

```
2016-02-18 - 1.0
```
422 (451) MAN 32/40 IMO Tier III, Project Guide – Marine, EN


```
It has to be ensured that combustible media will not be sucked in by the
engine.
Intake air quality according to the section Specification of intake air (com-
bustion air), Page 261 has to be guaranteed.
▪ Emergency stop system
The emergency stop system requires special care during planning, reali-
sation, commissioning and testing at site to avoid dangerous operating
conditions. The assessment of the effects on other system components
caused by an emergency stop of the engine must be carried out by
plant-side.
▪ Fail-safe 24 V power supply
Because engine control, alarm system and safety system are connected
to a 24 V power supply this part of the plant has to be designed fail-safe
to ensure a regular engine operation.
▪ Hazards by rotating parts/shafts
Contact with rotating parts must be excluded by plant-side (e.g. free
shaft end, flywheel, coupling).
▪ Safeguarding of the surrounding area of the flywheel
The entire area of the flywheel has to be safeguarded by plant-side.
Special care must be taken, inter alia, to prevent from: ejection of parts,
contact with moving machine parts and falling into the flywheel area.
▪ Securing of the engine ́s turning gear
The turning gear has to be equipped with an optical and acoustic warn-
ing device. When the turning gear is first activated, there has to be a cer-
tain delay between the emission of the warning device's signals and the
start of the turning gear. The gear wheel of the turning gear has to be
covered. The turning gear should be equipped with a remote control,
allowing optimal positioning of the operator, overlooking the entire hazard
area (a cable of approximately 20 m length is recommended). Uninten-
tional engagement or start of the turning gear must be prevented reliably.
It has to be prescribed in the form of a working instruction that:
```
- the turning gear has to be operated by at least two persons
- the work area must be secured against unauthorised entry
- only trained personnel is permissible to operate the turning gear
▪ Securing of the starting air pipe
To secure against unintentional restarting of the engine during mainte-
nance work, a disconnection and depressurisation of the engine ́s start-
ing air system must be possible. A lockable starting air stop valve must
be provided in the starting air pipe to the engine.
▪ Securing of the turbocharger rotor
To secure against unintentional turning of the turbocharger rotor while
maintenance work, it must be possible to prevent draught in the exhaust
gas duct and, if necessary, to secure the rotor against rotation.
▪ Consideration of the blow-off zone of the crankcase cover ́s relief valves
During crankcase explosions, the resulting hot gases will be blown out of
the crankcase through the relief valves. This must be considered in the
overall planning.
▪ Installation of flexible connections
For installation of flexible connections follow strictly the information given
in the planning and final documentation and the manufacturer manual.

```

```
Flexible connections may be sensitive to corrosive media. For cleaning
only adequate cleaning agents must be used (see manufacturer manual).
Substances containing chlorine or other halogens are generally not per-
missible.
Flexible connections have to be checked regularly and replaced after any
damage or lifetime given in manufacturer manual.
▪ Connection of exhaust port of the turbocharger to the exhaust gas sys-
tem of the plant
The connection between the exhaust port of the turbocharger and the
exhaust gas system of the plant has to be executed gas tight and must
be equipped with a fire proof insulation.
The surface temperature of the fire insulation must not exceed 220 °C.
In workspaces and traffic areas, a suitable contact protection has to be
provided whose surface temperature must not exceed 60 °C.
The connection has to be equipped with compensators for longitudinal
expansion and axis displacement in consideration of the occurring vibra-
tions (the flange of the turbocharger reaches temperatures of up to
450 °C).
▪ Media systems
The stated media system pressures must be complied. It must be possi-
ble to close off each plant-side media system from the engine and to
depressurise these closed off pipings at the engine. Safety devices in
case of system overpressure must be provided.
▪ Drainable supplies and excipients
Supply system and excipient system must be drainable and must be
secured against unintentional recommissioning (EN 1037). Sufficient ven-
tilation at the filling, emptying and ventilation points must be ensured.
The residual quantities which must be emptied have to be collected and
disposed of properly.
▪ Spray guard has to be ensured for liquids possibly leaking from the
flanges of the plant ́s piping system. The emerging media must be
drained off and collected safely.
▪ Charge air blow-off piping (if applied)
The piping must be executed by plant-side and must be suitably isola-
ted. In workspaces and traffic areas, a suitable contact protection has to
be provided whose surface temperature must not exceed 60 °C.
▪ Signs
```
- Following figure shows exemplarily the risks in the area of a combus-
    tion engine. This may vary slightly for the specific engine.
    This warning sign has to be mounted clearly visibly at the engine as
    well as at all entrances to the engine room or to the power house.

- Prohibited area signs
    Dependending on the application, it is possible that specific operat-
    ing ranges of the engine must be prohibited.
    In these cases, the signs will be delivered together with the engine,
    which have to be mounted clearly visibly on places at the engine
    which allow intervention of the engine operation.
▪ Optical and acoustic warning device
Communication in the engine room/power house may be impaired by
noise. Acoustic warning signals might not be heard. Therefore it is nec-
essary to check where at the plant optical warning signals (e.g. flash
lamp) should be provided.
In any case, optical and acoustic warning devices are necessary while
using the turning gear and while starting/stopping the engine.

### 9.3 Engine running-in

```
Prerequisites
```
```
Engines require a running-in period in case one of the following conditions
applies:
▪ When put into operation on site, if
```
- after test run the pistons or bearings were dismantled for inspection
    or
- the engine was partially or fully dismantled for transport.
▪ After fitting new drive train components, such as cylinder liners, pistons,
piston rings, crankshaft bearings, big-end bearings and piston pin bear-
ings.
▪ After the fitting of used bearing shells.
▪ After long-term low load operation (> 500 operating hours).

```
Supplementary information
```
```
During the running-in procedure the unevenness of the piston-ring surfaces
and cylinder contact surfaces is removed. The running-in period is comple-
ted once the first piston ring perfectly seals the combustion chamber. i.e. the
first piston ring should show an evenly worn contact surface. If the engine is
subjected to higher loads, prior to having been running-in, then the hot
exhaust gases will pass between the piston rings and the contact surfaces of
the cylinder. The oil film will be destroyed in such locations. The result is
material damage (e.g. burn marks) on the contact surface of the piston rings
and the cylinder liner. Later, this may result in increased engine wear and
high lube oil consumption.
The time until the running-in procedure is completed is determined by the
properties and quality of the surfaces of the cylinder liner, the quality of the
fuel and lube oil, as well as by the load of the engine and speed. The run-
ning-in periods indicated in following figures may therefore only be regarded
as approximate values.
```
```
Operating media
```
```
The running-in period may be carried out preferably using MGO (DMA, DMZ)
or MDO (DMB).
The fuel used must meet the quality standards see section Specification for
engine supplies, Page 221 and the design of the fuel system.
For the running-in of gas four-stroke engines it is best to use the gas which is
to be used later in operation.
Diesel-gas engines are run in using diesel operation with the fuel intended as
the ignition oil.
The running-in lube oil must match the quality standards, with regard to the
fuel quality.

Engine running-in
```
```
The cylinder lubrication must be switched to "Running In" mode during com-
pletion of the running-in procedure. This is done at the control cabinet or at
the control panel (under "Manual Operation"). This ensures that the cylinder
lubrication is already activated over the whole load range when the engine
starts. The running-in process of the piston rings and pistons benefits from
the increased supply of oil. Cylinder lubrication must be returned to "Normal
Mode" once the running-in period has been completed.
Inspections of the bearing temperature and crankcase must be conducted
during the running-in period:
▪ The first inspection must take place after 10 minutes of operation at mini-
mum speed.
▪ An inspection must take place after operation at full load respectively
after operational output level has been reached.
The bearing temperatures (camshaft bearings, big-end and main bearings)
must be determined in comparison with adjoining bearings. For this purpose
an electrical sensor thermometer may be used as a measuring device.
At 85 % load and at 100 % load with nominal speed, the operating data
(ignition pressures, exhaust gas temperatures, charge pressure, etc.) must
be measured and compared with the acceptance report.
Dependent on the application the running-in programme can be derived from
the figures in paragraph Diagram(s) of standard running-in, Page 431. Dur-
ing the entire running-in period, the engine output has to be within the
marked output range. Critical speed ranges are thus avoided.
Most four-stroke engines are subjected to a test run at the manufacturer ́s
premises. As such, the engine has usually been run in. Nonetheless, after
installation in the final location, another running-in period is required if the pis-
tons or bearings were disassembled for inspection after the test run, or if the
engine was partially or fully disassembled for transport.
If during revision work the cylinder liners, pistons, or piston rings are
replaced, a new running-in period is required. A running-in period is also
required if the piston rings are replaced in only one piston. The running-in
period must be conducted according to following figures or according to the
associated explanations.
The cylinder liner may be re-honed according to Work Card 050.05, if it is
not replaced. A transportable honing machine may be requested from one of
our Service and Support Locations.
When used bearing shells are reused, or when new bearing shells are instal-
led, these bearings have to be run in. The running-in period should be 3 to 5
hours under progressive loads, applied in stages. The instructions in the pre-
ceding text segments, particularly the ones regarding the "Inspections", and
following figures must be observed.
Idling at higher speeds for long periods of operation should be avoided if at
all possible.
Continuous operation in the low load range may result in substantial internal
pollution of the engine. Residue from fuel and lube oil combustion may cause
deposits on the top-land ring of the piston exposed to combustion, in the
piston ring channels as well as in the inlet channels. Moreover, it is possible
that the charge air and exhaust pipes, the charge air cooler, the turbocharger
and the exhaust gas tank may be polluted with oil.

Since the piston rings have adapted themselves to the cylinder liner accord-
ing to the running load, increased wear resulting from quick acceleration and
possibly with other engine trouble (leaking piston rings, piston wear) should
be expected.
Therefore, after a longer period of low load operation (≥ 500 hours of opera-
tion) a running-in period should be performed again, depending on the
power, according to following figures.
Also for instruction see section Low load operation, Page 52.

For further information, you may contact the MAN Diesel & Turbo customer
service or the customer service of the licensee.

### 9.4 Definitions

```
Auxiliary GenSet/auxiliary generator operation
```
```
A generator is driven by the engine, hereby the engine is operated at con-
stant speed. The generator supplies the electrical power not for the main
drive, but for supply systems of the vessel.
The mean output range of the engine is between 40 to 80 %.
Loads beyond 100 % up to 110 % of the rated output are permissible only
for a short time to provide additional power for governing purpose only.
```
```
Blackout – Dead ship condition
```
```
The classification societies define blackout on board ships as a loss of elec-
trical power, but still all necessary alternative energies (e.g. start air, battery
electricity) for starting the engines are available.
Contrary to blackout dead ship condition is a loss of electrical power on
board a ship. The main and all other auxiliary GenSets are not in operation,
also all necessary alternative energies for starting the engines are not availa-
ble. But still it is assumed that the necessary energy for starting the engines
(e.g. emergency alternator) could be restored at any time.
```
```
Designation
```
```
▪ Designation of engine sides
```
- Coupling side, CS
    The coupling side is the main engine output side and is the side to
    which the propeller, the alternator or other working machine is cou-
    pled.
- Free engine end/counter coupling side, CCS
    The free engine end is the front face of the engine opposite the cou-
    pling side.

```
Designation of cylinders
```
```
The cylinders are numbered in sequence, from the coupling side, 1, 2, 3 etc.
In V engines, looking on the coupling side, the left hand row of cylinders is
designated A, and the right hand row is designated B. Accordingly, the cylin-
ders are referred to as A1-A2-A3 or B1-B2-B3, etc.

Electric propulsion
```
```
The generator being driven by the engine supplies electrical power to drive
an electric motor. The power of the electric motor is used to drive a control-
lable pitch or fixed pitch propeller, pods, thrusters, etc.
The mean output range of the engine is between 80 to 95 % and the fuel
consumption is optimised at 85 % load.
```
```
GenSet
```
```
The term "GenSet" is used, if engine and electrical alternator are mounted
together on a common base frame and form a single piece of equipment.
```
```
GenSet application (also applies to auxiliary engines on board ships)
```
```
Engine and electrical alternator mounted together form a single piece of
equipment to supply electrical power in places where electrical power (cen-
tral power) is not available, or where power is required only temporarily.
Standby GenSets are kept ready to supply power during temporary interrup-
tions of the main supply.
The mean output range of the engine is between 40 to 80 %.
Loads beyond 100 % up to 110 % of the rated output are permissible only
for a short time to provide additional power for governing purpose only.
```
```
Gross calorific value (GCV)
```
```
This value supposes that the water of combustion is entirely condensed and
that the heat contained in the water vapor is recovered.
```
```
Mechanical propulsion with controllable pitch propeller (CPP)
```
```
A propeller with adjustable blades is driven by the engine.
The CPP ́s pitch can be adjusted to absorb all the power that the engine is
capable of producing at nearly any rotational speed.
Thereby the mean output range of the engine is between 80 to 95 % and the
fuel consumption is optimised at 85 % load.
```
```
Mechanical propulsion with fixed pitch propeller (FPP)
```
```
A fixed pitch propeller is driven by the engine. The FPP is always working
very close to the theoretical propeller curve (power input ~ n^3 ). A higher tor-
que in comparison to the CPP even at low rotational speed is present.
To protect the engine against overloading its rated output is reduced up to
90 %. The turbocharging system is adapted. Engine speed reduction of up
to 10 % at maximum torque is permissible.
The mean output range of the engine is between 80 to 95 % of its available
output and the fuel consumption is optimised at 85 % load.
```
```
Multi-engine propulsion plant
```
```
In a multi-engine propulsion plant at least two or more engines are available
for propulsion.

```
Net calorific value (NCV)
```
```
This value supposes that the products of combustion contain the water
vapor and that the heat in the water vapor is not recovered.
```
```
Offshore application
```
```
Offshore construction and offshore drilling place high requirements regarding
the engine ́s acceleration and load application behaviour. Higher require-
ments exist also regarding the permissible engine ́s inclination.
The mean output range of the engine is between 15 to 60 %. Acceleration
from engine start up to 100 % load must be possible within a specified time.
```
```
Output
▪ ISO standard output (as specified in DIN ISO 3046-1)
Maximum continuous rating of the engine at nominal speed under
ISO conditions, provided that maintenance is carried out as specified.
▪ Operating-standard-output (as specified in DIN ISO 3046-1)
Maximum continuous rating of the engine at nominal speed taking in
account the kind of application and the local ambient conditions, provi-
ded that maintenance is carried out as specified. For marine applications
this is stated on the type plate of the engine.
▪ Fuel stop power (as specified in DIN ISO 3046-1)
Fuel stop power defines the maximum rating of the engine theoretical
possible, if the maximum possible fuel amount is used (blocking limit).
▪ Rated power (in accordance to rules of Germanischer Lloyd)
Maximum possible continuous power at rated speed and at defined
ambient conditions, provided that maintenances carried out as specified.
▪ Overload power (in accordance to rules of Germanischer Lloyd)
110 % of rated power, that can be demonstrated for marine engines for
an uninterrupted period of one hour.
▪ Output explanation
Power of the engine at distinct speed and distinct torque.
▪ 100 % output
100 % output is equal to the rated power only at rated speed. 100 %
output of the engine can be reached at lower speed also if the torque is
increased.
▪ Nominal output
= rated power.
▪ MCR
Maximum continuous rating.
▪ ECR
Economic continuous rating = output of the engine with the lowest fuel
consumption.

Suction dredger application (mechanical drive of pumps)
```
```
For direct drive of a suction dredger pump by the engine via gear box the
engine speed is directly influenced by the load on the suction pump.
To protect the engine against overloading its rated output is reduced up to
90 %. The turbocharging system is adapted. Engine speed reduction of up
to 20 % at maximum torque is released.
Possibly the permissible engine operating curve has to be adapted to the
pump characteristics by means of a power output adaption respectively the
power demand of the pump has to be optimised particularly while start-up
operation.
The mean output range of the engine is between 80 to 100 % of its available
output and the fuel consumption is optimised at 85 % load.
```
```
Waterjet application
```
```
A marine propulsion system that creates a jet of water that propels the ves-
sel. The waterjet is always working close to the theoretical propeller curve
(power input ~ n^3 ).
To protect the engine against overloading its rated output is reduced up to
90 %. The turbocharging system is adapted. Engine speed reduction of up
to 10 % at maximum torque is permissible.
The mean output range of the engine is between 80 % to 95 % of its availa-
ble output and the fuel consumption is optimised at 85 % load.

Weight definitions for SCR
▪ Handling weight (reactor only):
This is the "net weight" of the reactor without catalysts, relevant for trans-
port, logistics, etc.
▪ Operational weight (with catalysts):
That's the weight of the reactor in operation, that is equipped with a layer
of catalyst and the second layer empty – as reserve.
▪ Maximum weight structurally:
This is relevant for the static planning purposes maximum weight, that is
equipped with two layers catalysts.

### 9.7 Preservation, packaging, storage

### 9.7.1 General

```
Introduction
```
```
Engines are internally and externally treated with preservation agent before
delivery. The type of preservation and packaging must be adjusted to the
means of transport and to the type and period of storage. Improper storage
may cause severe damage to the product.
```
```
Packaging and preservation of engine
```
```
The type of packaging depends on the requirements imposed by means of
transport and storage period, climatic and environmental effects during
transport and storage conditions as well as on the preservative agent used.
As standard, engines are preserved for a storage period of 12 months and
for sea transport.

```
2016-02-18 - 1.0
```
442 (451) MAN 32/40 IMO Tier III, Project Guide – Marine, EN


```
Note:
The packaging must be protected against damage. It must only be removed
when a follow-up preservation is required or when the packaged material is
to be used.
```
```
Preservation and packaging of assemblies and engine parts
```
```
Unless stated otherwise in the order text, the preservation and packaging of
assemblies and engine parts must be carried out such that the parts will not
be damaged during transport and that the corrosion protection remains fully
intact for a period of at least 12 months when stored in a roofed dry room.
```
```
Transport
```
```
Transport and packaging of the engine, assemblies and engine parts must
be coordinated.
After transportation, any damage to the corrosion protection and packaging
must be rectified, and/or MAN Diesel & Turbo must be notified immediately.
```
### 9.7.2 Storage location and duration

```
Storage location
```
```
As standard, the engine is packaged and preserved for outdoor storage.
The storage location must meet the following requirements:
▪ Engine is stored on firm and dry ground.
▪ Packaging material does not absorb any moisture from the ground.
▪ Engine is accessible for visual checks.
```
```
Assemblies and engine parts must always be stored in a roofed dry room.
The storage location must meet the following requirements:
▪ Parts are protected against environmental effects and the elements.
▪ The room must be well ventilated.
▪ Parts are stored on firm and dry ground.
▪ Packaging material does not absorb any moisture from the ground.
▪ Parts cannot be damaged.
▪ Parts are accessible for visual inspection.
▪ An allocation of assemblies and engine parts to the order or requisition
must be possible at all times.
Note:
Packaging made of or including VCI paper or VCI film must not be opened or
must be closed immediately after opening.
```
```
Storage conditions
```
```
In general the following requirements must be met:
▪ Minimum ambient temperature: –10 °C
▪ Maximum ambient temperature: +60 °C
▪ Relative humidity: < 60 %

```

```
In case these conditions cannot be met, contact MAN Diesel & Turbo for
clarification.
```
```
Storage period
```
```
The permissible storage period of 12 months must not be exceeded.
Before the maximum storage period is reached:
▪ Check the condition of the stored engine, assemblies and parts.
▪ Renew the preservation or install the engine or components at their
intended location.
```
### 9.7.3 Follow-up preservation when preservation period is exceeded

```
A follow-up preservation must be performed before the maximum storage
period has elapsed, i.e. generally after 12 months.
Request assistance by authorised personnel of MAN Diesel & Turbo.
```
### 9.7.4 Removal of corrosion protection

```
Packaging and corrosion protection must only be removed from the engine
immediately before commissioning the engine in its installation location.
Remove outer protective layers, any foreign body from engine or component
(VCI packs, blanking covers, etc.), check engine and components for dam-
age and corrosion, perform corrective measures, if required.
The preservation agents sprayed inside the engine do not require any special
attention. They will be washed off by engine oil during subsequent engine
operation.
Contact MAN Diesel & Turbo if you have any questions.
```
### 9.8 Engine colour

```
Engine standard colour according RAL colour table is RAL 7040.
